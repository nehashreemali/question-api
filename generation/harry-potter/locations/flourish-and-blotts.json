  "content": "Flourish and Blotts Bookseller was a bookshop in North Side, Diagon Alley, about halfway down the street on the left hand side.[1] Established in 1454,[3] it was where most Hogwarts students purchased their schoolbooks. The shop was filled with bookshelves stacked to the ceiling.[2]\n\nThe shop had had a few problems with certain books, such as The Invisible Book of Invisibility which cost them a great deal of money to buy and had gone missing very early in its hours of being sold due to its invisibility, and The Monster Book of Monsters which tore itself apart and bit the manager when he tried to get a copy off the shelf.[4]\n\nThe shop held occasional book-signings, such as when Gilderoy Lockhart stopped by in 1992 to sign copies of his latest book Magical Me.[5] Flourish and Blotts also ran a service which enabled purchasers to buy books via owl delivery.[6] They also took advance orders for books that were in high demand, such as The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore.[7]\n\nFlourish and Blotts was first established in Diagon Alley in the year of 1454, not long after the establishment of the alley.[3]\n\nOn 19 March 1927, Flourish and Blotts and Obscurus Books held a book launch party for Newt Scamander's Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.[8]\n\nBefore the start of the 1984–1985 school year, Jacob's sibling visited Flourish and Blotts to buy all their textbooks required for their first year at Hogwarts.[9] Around the time of Valentine's Day in February 1988, Gilderoy Lockhart held a book signing for Voyages with Vampires at Flourish and Blotts that his fans attended, including Molly Weasley. During this event, he announced that a special group of fifth year Hogwarts students in attendance (Andre Egwu, Barnaby Lee, Jacob's sibling, Merula Snyde, Penny Haywood and Talbott Winger) would become his \"apprentices\" for a special Valentine's Day project.[10]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, Jacob's sibling and either Merula Snyde, Bill Weasley or Jae Kim came to the shop to ask Madam Villanelle about Mundungus Fletcher.[11] In February 1989, around Valentine's Day, Gilderoy Lockart held a book signing in the shop. Jacob's sibling approached him and asked him for advice about love to help them write an essay for a competition.[12] At the end of this school year, Jacob's sibling and Bill came again to purchase some books about curse-breaking.[13] Also during this school year, the Walter Aragon Wizard Chess Competition was hosted in Flourish and Blotts, which the Beauxbatons Wizard's Chess champion Celine Castillon competed in.[14]\n\nDuring the 1989–1990 school year, Jacob went to the shop to buy books about Mahoutokoro School of Magic. Jacob's sibling later came and Madam Villanelle told them what their brother had done there.[15] Jacob's sibling later came to talk to Chester Davies about infiltrating the Ministry of Magic.[16] Jacob's sibling, Chiara Lobosca and Talbott Winger later came to read up about Grindylows, but found some information on the Whomping Willow instead.[17] Jacob's sibling and Chiara later returned to research about Merpeople and found that the local Merpeople were fond of music.[18] At some point near the end of the school year, Jacob's sibling returned to Flourish and Blotts with Mundungus Fletcher to ask Madam Villanelle for information of the dark witch who had been gathering information of Jacob's sibling and their wand (who turned out to be Verucca Buckthorn-Snyde).[19]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, Jacob's sibling and Ben Copper paid Madam Villanelle a visit in Flourish and Blotts during their investigation of Garrick Ollivander's misfiring wand.[20]\n\nLater during this school year, Jacob's sibling encountered Ben Copper in the shop, who was there studying for his upcoming N.E.W.Ts and to remember his deceased friend Rowan Khanna, who loved going to the bookshop.[21]\n\nFlourish and Blotts was briefly closed during the summer of 1991, as they were dealing with an outbreak of bookworms.[22] On 31 July 1991, Harry Potter and Rubeus Hagrid visited Flourish and Blotts whilst shopping in Diagon Alley, in order to purchase all of Harry's assigned Hogwarts textbooks. Harry also was interested in a copy of Curses and Counter-Curses, however Hagrid made him put the book down after telling him he was too young to begin casting curses.[2]\n\nSometime in early 1992, Flourish and Blotts was closed as it attempted to locate its order of Disappearing Ink. In August of 1992, famous wizard author Gilderoy Lockhart held a book signing at the shop and used it as an opportunity to announce his taking of the post of Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry that year. In an effort to gain more publicity, he dragged Harry Potter into the spotlight against his will and gifted Harry a complete set of his books. That same day, a fistfight occurred between Lucius Malfoy and Arthur Weasley, and Lucius Malfoy secretly gave Tom Riddle's Diary to Ginny Weasley.[5] During the Christmas holidays, the bookshop was temporarily closed, as they were still tidying up after Gilderoy Lockhart's book signing in August.[23]\n\nIn late summer of 1993, the front window of Flourish and Blotts held an iron cage filled with hundreds of copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. To deal with the vicious books set for the third year Care of Magical Creatures class taught by Rubeus Hagrid, the harassed manager had to gear up with thick gloves and jab at them with a knobbly walking stick, as the books tend to viciously rip and tear each other apart.[4]\n\nWhen Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley went to the shop to buy their schoolbooks, the manager almost cried when Ron and Hermione said they wanted two copies of The Monster Book of Monsters, but was very relieved when Harry noted that he already had a copy. Harry also asks for a copy of Unfogging the Future to which the manager leads them to a small corner in the back of the shop where a small table lies for books on Fortune Telling, such as: Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate Yourself Against Shocks, Death Omens: What to Do When You Know the Worst is Coming, and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.[4]\n\nIn the summer of 1994, Molly Weasley went to Flourish and Blotts to get three copies of The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 4 for Harry, Ron, and Hermione.[24]\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Harry, Hermione and Ron went to Diagon Alley to buy their school supplies for their upcoming sixth year, with Ron's parents Arthur and Molly, along with his sister Ginny. Because Molly was feared of entering Diagon Alley without her husband Arthur due to the return of Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters, Ron joked to his mother that Voldemort would not be hiding behind a bookshelf in Flourish and Blotts. When they were all at Diagon Alley, Molly, Arthur and Ginny went to Flourish and Blotts, whilst Harry, Hermione and Ron went to Madam Malkin's instead.[25] When the school year had started, as Harry and Ron thought they would not make the cut to proceed to N.E.W.T.-level Potions class, they did not buy the necessary textbook.[26]\n\nHowever, with the new Potions Master Horace Slughorn lowering the entrance standards to 'Exceeds Expectations' (as opposed to Severus Snape's only admitting 'Outstanding' students to his classes), Harry and Ron took the subject,[26] and wrote to Flourish and Blotts to get a copy of the book delivered to them.[26][6]\n\nFlourish and Blotts was filled to the brim with books. Shelves upon shelves lined the walls, from ceiling to floor. The books were of all sizes and different varieties.[2] In fact, there were so many books that various signs were posted throughout the shop, as a means of helping customers find what they needed. The front windows usually contained displays of gold-embossed spellbooks the size of paving slabs.[4]\n\nIn addition to the store's manager, who at times helped customers himself,[4] the store also employed an assistant manager (paid 42 Galleons a month)[33] and an assistant.[5] The job was not altogether easy, as wizarding books might have attempted to bite or simply gone completely invisible,[4] and fights — like the scuffle between Arthur Weasley and Lucius Malfoy in 1992, that sent books raining down on everyone's heads[5] — were apparently commonplace enough that a classified posting for a new assistant manager required that he or she be \"good at breaking up fights\".[33]",
