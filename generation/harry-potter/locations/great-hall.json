  "content": "The Great Hall in the Hogwarts Castle was the main gathering area in the school, which was located off the Entrance Hall. It was a large hall where students and teachers dined and congregated.[1] Three meals a day were hosted in this hall.\n\nThe Great Hall was the main place where students received their meals and daily owl post.[2] They also held certain special events, such as the Sorting Ceremony,[1] and the Hallowe'en Feast.[3]\n\nThe large hall had enough space to hold every student, as well as the main staff and guests. The Hall had tall walls that reached up to the ceiling, which was covered with floating candles and enchanted to look like the sky above.[1]\n\nAt the front of the hall was the staff table, also known as the High Table, which was designed to house the entire Hogwarts staff. In the centre of the table was a throne chair where the present Headteacher sat.[1] At the left of the table was a door which led to a chamber with portraits.[4]\n\nThe Great Hall had also held many important events, such as the defeat of Lord Voldemort at the hands of Harry Potter, ending the Battle of Hogwarts and the climatic end of the Second Wizarding War.[5]\n\nThe Great Hall was a large hall with four long tables where students of each House sat during the day and at mealtimes. The staff table was at the front, where the entire Hogwarts staff sat. There was a throne-like chair in the centre of the table where the current Headmaster or Headmistress sat. The ceiling of the Great Hall was covered with candles and it was enchanted to look like the sky above.[1] To the left of the table was a door which led to a chamber with portraits.[4] There was a gallery which overlooked the hall.[6]\n\nFrom the staff table, the House tables were as follows (from left to right): Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Slytherin.[1]\n\nDuring the Hallowe'en feast, the hall was festooned with sweets-filled pumpkins, bats, orange streamers, water snakes and many other Hallowe'en-related decorations.[3] At Christmas, before and during the holidays, twelve large Christmas trees were placed around the room.[7]\n\nThe Start-of-Term Feast was a traditional part of the school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, held in the Great Hall. The gathering was held on the evening of 1 September, following the arrival of the students from the Hogwarts Express. The Sorting Ceremony was held at the beginning, before the Headteacher made their announcement and commenced the meal.[1]\n\nThe Hallowe'en feast at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry occured on 31 October every year. The Great Hall was decorated with Hallowe'en decor, such as sweet-filled pumpkins, bats, orange streamers and water snakes. At the end, there was entertainment, such as the ghosts of Hogwarts popping up out of the wall and performing formation gliding.[3]\n\nIt was a highly anticipated feast which most Hogwarts students looked forward to every year.[3]\n\nThe Christmas Feast was held on Christmas Day. It was attended by the teachers and any student who had chosen to remain at Hogwarts over the Christmas Holidays. The feast was prepared by the house-elves in the kitchens, and consisted of a hundred fat, roast turkeys, mountains of roasted and boiled potatoes, platters of fat chipolatas, tureens of buttered peas, silver boats of thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce.\n\nFor dessert, flaming Christmas puddings were served, with silver sickles hidden within the pudding. There were also surprise firecrackers, which, when popped, gave forth a gift.[7]\n\nOn 17 December 1992, Professor Lockhart created the duelling club when the Chamber of Secrets was opened. He was given permission by Headmaster Albus Dumbledore to teach students how to duel, in an attempt to help them learn to protect themselves. Lockhart was joined by Professor Snape, who worked as his assistant.[8] In 1996, the Gryffindor Duelling Club held their gatherings in the Great Hall.[9]\n\nOn 14 February 1993, Lockhart decided to organise a \"morale-booster\" against the gloomy atmosphere generated by the Chamber of Secrets' opening. Come morning of Valentine's Day, Lockhart's \"morale-booster\" was revealed to be an overly lavish party, mainly for him to garner attention for himself more than to help the school residents regain their confidence.\n\nAs the opening of this party, he overly decorated the Great Hall during breakfast with lurid pink flowers, falling heart-shaped confetti, and Lockhart himself dressed in matching pink robes. This vivid scene disgusted the majority of the staff, as well as some male students. However, female students who fawned over Lockhart's charm, were rather excited by this. When Harry first walked into the Great Hall for breakfast, the severe change in decor made him thought he walked through the wrong doors initially.[10]\n\nThe Yule Ball, a formal dance held on the evening of Christmas Day, was a tradition of the Triwizard Tournament, though not regularly held at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[11]\n\nThe tournament was revived at Hogwarts in 1994, and they held the Yule Ball in the Great Hall for fourth-year students or above, though younger students could also go if an older student invited them to accompany them. The ball began at 8 pm and ended at midnight.[11]\n\nIt started with a meal, with the champions and their partners dining at the head table with the teachers and judges, before the room was transformed into a dance floor. There was also a stage for the performing band.[11]\n\nApparition is an optional twelve-week class offered at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for sixth-year students to learn how to Apparate.[12]\n\nThe class began shortly after the Christmas Holidays and was offered to students who were seventeen, or who will turn seventeen during the school year. The class costed twelve Galleons.[12] It was taught by British Ministry of Magic employee Wilkie Twycross in 1997. Although mainly taught outside, weather conditions meant the lesson had to begin in the Great Hall before they moved out. The Anti-Apparition Charm placed on the entire school was temporarily removed in the Great Hall for students to practise.[13]\n\nAn O.W.L. (Ordinary Wizarding Level) was a subject-specific test taken during Hogwarts students' fifth year, administrated by the Wizarding Examinations Authority. The score made by a student on a particular O.W.L. determined whether or not he or she will be allowed to continue taking that subject in subsequent school years.[14]\n\nDuring these examinations, a giant clock face and a huge swinging pendulum were placed at the far end of the hall in order for students and examiners to keep an eye on the time.[15]\n\nN.E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests) were subject-specific exams that seventh-year wizards and witches at Hogwarts took to help place them in some careers. As not all wizards passed or even took the N.E.W.T.s, they could find other jobs using their O.W.L. results.[16]\n\nThe End-of-Term Feast (or Leaving Feast) was a traditional part of the school year at Hogwarts, held in the Great Hall. It occured on the last night of the term; the Feast was notable for including the awarding of the House Cup to the house with the highest points.[17]\n\nSometime in the early 20th century, when Professor Dippet was Headmaster, the hall was used to host a play version of The Fountain of Fair Fortune. It was directed by Herbert Beery. An hour before the play began, the students playing Amata and Sir Luckless, who were dating, broke up when he left her for the student playing Asha.[18]\n\nAs the curtain rose, an Ashwinder started a fire as the girls playing Amata and Asha started fiercely duelling, with Professor Beery getting stuck in the middle. The staff had to evacuate the hall as the fire consumed the hall. Since the play ended in disastrous results, the staff decided never to put one on ever again.[18]\n\nOn 2 May 1998, the final battle between Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter took place here as the conclusion to the Battle of Hogwarts and the Second Wizarding War, and became Voldemort's death-place.[5] Shortly before then, the Great Hall was also the place where many other duels took place.[19]\n\nBefore Harry duelled Voldemort, Bellatrix Lestrange duelled Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, and Luna Lovegood. At the same time Lord Voldemort duelled Professor McGonagall, Professor Slughorn, and Kingsley Shacklebolt.\n\nMolly Weasley also duelled Bellatrix after the latter nearly murdered her daughter. Molly emerged the victor of this duel. When Voldemort saw this his anger blasted his three adversaries away, but Harry stepped out from under his Invisibility Cloak and took on Voldemort and defeated him.\n\nDuring moments of peace, it served as a holding area for the dead and wounded and when the battle was over, it was a gathering place for the survivors.[20]\n\nIn 1932, Albus Dumbledore, Newton Scamander and his army met in the Great Hall to discuss their plans.[21] The Muggle Jacob Kowalski ate lunch with two Gryffindor students and one Ravenclaw, who asked him about his wand.[21] In 1993, the students were forced to sleep there over night in sleeping bags after Sirius Black broke in.[22] The Divination Workshop was held in the Great Hall at 12:45. This suggests that lunch in the hall was to be finished by that time.[23]",
