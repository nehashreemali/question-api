  "content": "The phoenix was a large swan-sized scarlet magical bird with red and gold plumage, along with a golden beak and talons, black eyes, and a tail as long as a peacock's. Phoenixes would usually nest on mountain peaks and were gentle herbivores, that were not known for fighting. A phoenix was also one of the most independent and detached creatures in the world.\n\nA phoenix was normally really magnificent, but every so often, they had to rejuvenate themselves with an event known as the Burning Day, in which the bird would suddenly burst into flames, only to rise from the ashes shortly after as a newborn chick. In a number of days, they grew back to full size.[1][2] As phoenixes approached their Burning Day, they looked dreadful, resembling a half-plucked turkey. Their eyes became dull, their feathers started to fall out, and it began to make gagging noises. Thanks to this ability, phoenixes lived to an immense age, perhaps even forever.[2]\n\nIts feathers could be used as the core of a wand and were designated by Garrick Ollivander as one of the \"Supreme Cores\", which was a distinction shared by only two other beasts. Its scarlet feathers glowed faintly in darkness, while its golden tail feathers were hot to the touch.[2]\n\nIt was a possible, rare corporeal form of the Patronus Charm,[6][7] such as Albus Dumbledore's Patronus.[7]\n\nPhoenixes were common decorative motifs in the Wizarding world. Four forty-foot tall gilded statues of phoenixes were located in the lobby of the Magical Congress of the United States of America,[8][9] and the Phoenix Arch was located at the entrance to Place Cachée in Paris.[10]\n\nPhoenixes had crimson feathers on their body that glowed faintly in darkness and a golden tail as long as a peacock's that was hot to the touch.[2] It was unknown if they were actually capable of burning someone as neither Harry Potter — when Fawkes carried him from the Chamber of Secrets — nor Albus Dumbledore — when he escaped the Ministry officials with Fawkes's help — were burned by his tail feathers;[11][12] however, it was possible that Fawkes could control the temperature of his tail feathers and simply chose not to burn them.\n\nA male phoenix had scarlet head feathers, a gleaming gold beak and talons, dark blue speckles on his face, and his eyes were black. A female phoenix on the other hand had orange head feathers, her beak and talons were black, she had light blue speckles on her face, and her eyes were red with black pupils.\n\nThe egg of the Phoenix was glossy green or blue in colour. They did not need to be incubated in order to hatch; however, it sometimes took several years for one to hatch.[13]\n\nThe most startling of the phoenix's abilities was its ability to regenerate itself. It periodically burst into flames when its body became old, and rose from the ashes as a newborn chick. This event is called a Burning Day, although it's unknown how often it occurred.[1] The Burning Day gave these birds a great life span, in fact, phoenixes may have been one of the only species to have true immortality.\n\nA phoenix had the ability to take the full force of a Killing Curse and still be reborn.[12] No other living creature was known to be able to survive it, unless they had Sacrificial protection. Phoenixes were also immune to the gaze of a basilisk, which would normally kill anyone who made direct eye contact with it, or petrify anyone through indirect eye contact, such as by seeing the reflection of the massive serpent in a mirror.[11]\n\nPhoenixes were capable of more with their flames than just renewing their lifecycle. The phoenix could also disappear and reappear elsewhere at will in a bursts of flames, leaving behind a single golden tail feather. The Phoenix in question could also take whoever was holding them along. An ability very similar to Apparition.[14][15]\n\nAdditionally, their tears had potent healing capabilities. For instance, phoenix tears were the only known antidote to basilisk venom.[11] Their tears were also able to bring a person back even from the brink of death,[11] similar to Unicorn blood, but without the cursed life. Aside from their tears, the pellets that Phoenixes coughed up had healing properties of their own, which they were prized for. Additionally, the pellets contained rare gemstones known as Phoenix flints, which were said to have the power to protect the wearer from the cold at high altitudes.[16]\n\nPhoenixes were capable of lifting a great weight with their tails, such as being able to effortlessly fly up a distance with four people (one adult and three adolescents) holding on to its tail.[11]\n\nPhoenix song had a deep emotional impact on those who heard it. Magical in nature, it touched a listener's very soul and was able to provide support and comfort.[11][17][3] Furthermore, the phoenix song would increase the courage of those who were good and struck fear into the hearts of those who served evil.[2] Its most powerful performances were known to be when the phoenix suffered emotional instability or distress, such as the death of its master.[3]\n\nAs stated by Dumbledore, they were extremely loyal creatures, and were capable of arriving to the aid of beings who share a similar devotion to their master.[1] This was how Fawkes arrived to assist Harry Potter in slaying the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets during his second year at Hogwarts.[11]\n\nPhoenix was the language spoken by phoenixes. Although, to most people, it would sound like squawking, to those who understood their language, it was complex and magical and able to convey a wide range of thoughts and emotions with just a few sounds. Garrick Ollivander spoke it a little, and presumably everyone who owned a phoenix did to some degree.[18]\n\nFire appeared to have an unknown but profound effect on phoenixes, as Gellert Grindelwald was effortlessly capable of instantly turning a baby phoenix into a full adult by conjuring fire from his hand and setting the baby bird ablaze, from which it emerged as a full adult after being briefly covered by the flames, although by all fairness, Grindelwald was an immensely powerful wizard who was extremely skilled in Wandless magic and fairly apt at handling magical creatures.[5] Nevertheless, considering a phoenix's fire-related powers, it was likely that fire could be used to strengthen them. Phoenixes also burst into flame when they disapparate and on Burning Day, before they emerge from their ashes as a newborn.\n\nPhoenixes were very difficult to domesticate, as Newton Scamander said in his book Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them: \"The phoenix gains an XXXX rating not because it is aggressive, but because very few wizards have ever succeeded in domesticating it.\"[2] There were two known domesticated phoenixes; one was Albus Dumbledore's pet phoenix Fawkes,[1] and the other was Sparky, the team mascot for the New Zealand Quidditch team, the Moutohora Macaws.[19]\n\nPhoenixes that had been domesticated were extremely loyal to their owners, and would depart to find their own paths if their owners died, rather than finding a new master.[3][20]\n\nPhoenix feathers were a powerful magical substance and, as such, were an accepted wand core.[22][23] Fawkes gave two feathers, which ended up in the wands of Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort,[22] which was said to be the reason why they locked in Priori Incantatem when the two wizards attempted to duel each other in the Little Hangleton graveyard.[17] Due to phoenixes having been very difficult to tame and were one of the most detached creatures in the world, the wands with such feathers were the pickiest of owners. The wands containing this core sometimes acted on their own accord, due to having the most initiative of all core types. Phoenix feathers were sometimes used as writing quills.[23]",
