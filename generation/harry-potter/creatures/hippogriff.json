  "content": "A Hippogriff was a magical beast that had the front legs, wings, and head of a giant eagle and the body, hind legs and tail of a horse. It was very similar to another magical creature, the Griffin, with the horse rear replacing the lion rear.[3]\n\nThe breeding of fancy Hippogriffs was an established wizarding career, with known breeders including Newton Scamander's mother. Images of fancy Hippogriffs were sometimes put onto calendars.[5]\n\nA Hippogriff was one rare possible corporeal form of the Patronus Charm.[6]\n\nHippogriffs had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of horses, but the front legs, wings, and heads of giant eagles, with cruel, steel-coloured beaks and large, brilliantly orange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and deadly-looking.[2]\n\nIt was stated that once one got over the initial shock of seeing something that was half horse, half bird, one started to appreciate the Hippogriff's gleaming coats, which changed smoothly from feathers to hair. Hippogriffs came in several different colours, including stormy grey, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black.[2]\n\nHippogriffs were carnivorous and were extremely dangerous until tamed, which should only be attempted by a trained witch or wizard. The diet of the Hippogriff consisted mainly of insects, birds, and small mammals such as ferrets. They would sometimes paw at the ground for worms if no other food was readily available.[7]\n\nWhen breeding, Hippogriffs built nests on the ground in which they laid only a single, fragile egg. The egg usually hatched in twenty-four hours. Infant Hippogriffs were capable of flight within a week, but it took many months before they were strong enough to accompany their parents on long journeys.[3]\n\nWhen riding a Hippogriff, one had to sit with their legs right behind the wing joints. The rider had to be careful not to pull out any feathers, as the Hippogriff would not like that.[8]\n\nWhen humans approached Hippogriffs, proper etiquette had to be maintained to avoid danger. Hippogriffs were intensely proud creatures, so an individual had to show proper respect by bowing to them and waiting for them to bow in return before approaching. Eye contact should be maintained at all times, without a single blink.[2]\n\nThe Hippogriff should be allowed to make the first move, as that was polite. If offended, it might attack. Hippogriffs were tamable, but only by experts in their care (such as Rubeus Hagrid, Care of Magical Creatures Professor and Gamekeeper at Hogwarts).[2]\n\nAlthough proud, Hippogriffs could also be fiercely loyal and protective of those who had earned their trust, as demonstrated by Buckbeak on at least two occasions: when he attacked Severus Snape in defence of Harry Potter during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, and again when he led Hogwarts' Thestrals in attacking Voldemort's giants during the Battle of Hogwarts.[9]\n\nHippogriff-baiting was a section of wizarding law relating to wizards intentionally baiting hippogriffs into hostile behaviour. There was one known example of a hippogriff being let off.[10] A book on hippogriff-baiting was kept in the Legal Section in the Hogwarts Library.[11]\n\nOwners of Hippogriffs were required by law to cast a Disillusionment Charm on the creature every day to prevent it from being seen by Muggles. Using Hippogriffs for personal transportation was also illegal under the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.[12]\n\nA herd of Hippogriffs were kept at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Rubeus Hagrid used them in his first Care of Magical Creatures class in 1993.\n\nBuckbeak was a hippogriff that was a part of the Hogwarts' herd and had many encounters with the trio of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ronald Weasley during the course of their education. He lived with Rubeus Hagrid and many other Hippogriffs, but was later sentenced to death due to attacking Draco Malfoy after being taunted and provoked by him.[2] Buckbeak was sentenced for this act by the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, most of whom had been threatened by Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father, into voting for that verdict.[10]\n\nWith the help of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and her Time-Turner, Buckbeak escaped execution in 1994 and he came under the care of Sirius Black.[7] Sirius kept Buckbeak with him while on the run during the 1994–1995 school year, and later kept him in his mother's bedroom while in hiding at 12 Grimmauld Place.[5]\n\nAfter Sirius's death, Buckbeak came to be owned by Harry Potter through Sirius's will, though Harry allowed him to live with Hagrid. He participated in two battles of the Second Wizarding War, most notably the Battle of Hogwarts.[13] He also showed great affection and loyalty to Harry, defending him whenever he was in danger.[14][8]\n\nAn onyx-coloured Hippogriff named Caligo existed in the 19th-century.[15]\n\nA Hippogriff was part of the Circus Arcanus in 1927.[16]\n\nHippogriffs were among the magical creatures that Hogwarts students should avoid listed within the internal Hogwarts guide titled Kettleburn's Classification of Chompers by Silvanus Kettleburn.[17]\n\nDuring the Yule Ball at Hogwarts in 1994, Hippogriffs were mentioned in the Weird Sisters song, Do the Hippogriff. The song encouraged listeners to do a dance that drew its inspiration from this creature, \"flyin' off from a cliff\" and \"swooping down to the ground...\"[18]\n\nIn the winter of 1995, Sirius Black sang a Christmas carol, \"God Rest Ye, Merry Hippogriffs\".[5]\n\nA Hippogriff was discovered by Mathilda Grimblehawk and her partner to have attacked Gordon Horton, Quidditch keeper for the Chudley Cannons, while defending its nest and young in the Old Bell Tower. It was subsequently relocated.[19]\n\nIn the 21st century, adult and baby Hippogriffs were caught in Confoundables caused by the Calamity and had to be rescued by volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[17] One such Hippogriff was seen in Japan.[20]\n\nA Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force assisted Rubeus Hagrid in dealing with a sickness affecting the Hippogriff population in the Forbidden Forest. Although the situation initially seemed bleak, the Calamity Investigator was able to quickly turn it around, saving many Hippogriff lives. The celebrity Magizoologist Naasz later created or obtained a trinket described as a \"green-dyed Hippogriff feather with tiny baubles hanging equidistantly around the spine\". It was sent to the same Calamity Investigator, who thought it looked like a rather cheap souvenir. Naasz insisted that it was a valuable artefact, and carrying it seemed to increase the investigator's chances of keeping a Magizoological Trace in their sights.[17]\n\nDuring a Calamity surge focused on baby beasts in July 2020, baby Hippogriffs had to be rescued by volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force. Constance Pickering recalled reading a recent Ministry report regarding an uptick in Hippogriff poaching in the Forbidden Forest, deciding to look further into it.[21]\n\n\"Hippogriff\" is derived from the Greek word \"hippos\" meaning \"horse\", and the magical creature known as the griffin. In this case, it has the body of a horse as opposed to a lion, but keeps the head of an eagle.",
