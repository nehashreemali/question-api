  "content": "A Dementor was a gliding, wraithlike Dark creature, widely considered to be one of the foulest of the Dark creatures to inhabit the wizarding world. Dementors literally fed on human happiness and thus generated feelings of depression and despair in any person in close proximity to them. They could also consume a person's soul, leaving their victims in a permanent vegetative state, and thus were often referred to as \"soul-sucking fiends\", and the people they left soulless were deemed to have been turned into an \"empty-shell\".[4]\n\nDementors were closely associated with Azkaban,[1] as they were formerly employed by the British Ministry of Magic as the prison guards, and were not known to permanently inhabit any other location.\n\nThe Dementors of Azkaban were under the employment of the Ministry until mid-1996, when Lord Voldemort was sighted in the Ministry, and their defection to the Dark Lord's cause became undeniable. After the end of the Second Wizarding War in 1998, the Ministry was re-formed, and newly-appointed Minister for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt ensured that they were not used by the government again, presumably due to their changing allegiance and support of Voldemort, and due to ethical reforms in the Ministry and Wizarding society at large.[5] It is not known what happened to the Dementors after they were rejected from their former posts as guards of Azkaban.\n\nThere were certain defences one could use against Dementors, specifically the Patronus Charm. Dementors held no true loyalty, except to whoever could provide them with the most people to feed on. They seemingly could not be destroyed, though their numbers could be limited if the conditions in which they multiply, i.e. despair and degradation, were prevented from forming.[5]\n\nAccording to an ancient story, the Dark wizard Raczidian lived with a colony of Dementors at his castle. Upon being refused marriage to a witch named Eliana from a wizarding village, Raczidian ordered his Dementors to destroy the village unless Eilana was brought to him. The villagers fought off the Dementors with their Patronuses but were overpowered, until a young wizard called Illyius conjured a small but powerful mouse Patronus, repelling all the Dementors from the village and saving it.[6]\n\nThe history of Dementors in relation to the wizarding society in Britain was inextricably tied up with one location: Azkaban. The island in the North Sea on which the wizard prison was built had never appeared on any map, wizard or Muggle. Perhaps its first resident, or even creator, Ekrizdis, practised the worst kinds of Dark Arts and constructed a fortress on the island, luring Muggle sailors there to torture and murder them. After his death, the various concealment charms placed on the island faded, and the Ministry became aware of the mysterious site's existence.[1]\n\nThose who entered the deserted fortress to investigate discovered, among other horrors, an infestation of Dementors. Fearing the reprisal of these Dark entities should anyone try to evict them, the Ministry decided to let the sizeable colony remain unchecked.[1]\n\nWhen Damocles Rowle was elected Minister for Magic in 1718, he insisted on utilising Azkaban's Dark pedigree, seeing the Dementors as a potential asset: putting them to work as guards would save expense, time, and lives. This plan was eventually put into motion and, despite protests, Azkaban remained the prison of the wizarding world right up until the Second Wizarding War, mostly because of its near-zero breakout rate. From that point on, the Dementors served the Ministry of Magic as the guards of Azkaban, as the arrangement allowed them to feed on the emotions of the prisoners within its walls.[1]\n\nSomewhere between 1733 and 1747, Minister Eldritch Diggory visited Azkaban and was horrified at the sheer despair and insanity that the Dementors induced within the prisoners. He formed a committee to find alternative solutions, the least of which was to remove the Dementors, which met opposition from those who feared a mainland invasion by the Dark creatures if they were deprived of their food source. Alas, Diggory died of Dragon Pox while in office, and thus the campaign to find an alternative to Azkaban's Dementors stalled. Though their primary function was to guard Azkaban, Dementors also performs other services for the Ministry, such as being sent to guard other locations, escort prisoners to trial or even hunt down certain criminals.[1]\n\nAlthough many in the wizarding world felt that the Dementors were necessary to keeping the wizarding world safe from Voldemort's supporters and other dangerous criminals, some believed the Dementors to be inherently fickle and untrustworthy. Albus Dumbledore, in particular, thought it was a mistake for the Ministry to ever ally with such creatures,[7] though Alastor Moody thought violent criminals such as Death Eaters deserved such treatment.[8]\n\nDuring the 1987–1988 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Dark wizard cabal 'R' sent a Dementor to Hogwarts Castle, which attacked Penny Haywood and sent her to the Hospital Wing. Jacob's sibling investigated the Dementor sighting on the Training Grounds, and came across it. Eventually with the help of their friends Merula Snyde and Nymphadora Tonks, they banished the Dementor from Hogwarts with the Patronus Charm.[9]\n\nDuring the 1989–1990 school year, Jacob's sibling, Merula Snyde, and Ben Copper encountered several Dementors in the Forest Grove of the Forbidden Forest which surrounded them. This encounter with Dementors was the result of the students going into the forest to intercept a possible meeting between Jacob (an individual formerly involved in a search for the Cursed Vaults) and the organisation 'R'.\n\nA lioness Patronus then appeared and banished the Dementors, which was cast by their mortal nemesis Patricia Rakepick. Rakepick then duelled the students.[10] The duel eventually resulted in the death of Rowan Khanna, who died to protect Ben Copper from being hit by a lethal Killing Curse cast by Rakepick.[10]\n\nDuring the 1993–1994 school year, a legion of Dementors were sent to guard Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry against the deemed \"mass murderer\" Sirius Black, who had recently escaped from Azkaban in 1993. The Dementors were stationed at Hogwarts because of the Ministry believing (incorrectly as it turned out) that Sirius was wanting to kill Harry Potter out of retribution for his \"master's\" defeat.\n\nThe Dementors searched for Sirius on the Hogwarts Express, where Harry Potter had his first encounter with one, during which he was protected by the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Remus Lupin. Whenever brought into close proximity with a Dementor, Harry was forced to relive his worst memory: hearing the last moments of his parents' lives before they were murdered by Lord Voldemort.\n\nWhile the Dementors were at Hogwarts, Headmaster Albus Dumbledore refused to let them enter the school grounds but was unable to prevent their presence entirely, and so warned his students to give the Dementors no reason to harm them. So dangerous did Dumbledore consider them to be that, even when Sirius Black was found to have entered the school, he refused to let them search or enter the castle.\n\nHarry endured a second encounter with a group of Dementors during a Quidditch match, causing him to lose consciousness and suffer a fall from his broom. He was that time rescued by Dumbledore, who slowed Harry's fall and then drove the Dementors away with a Patronus. They had a particularly bad effect on Harry due to the memories from his miserable childhood with the Dursleys and a general lot of bad memories.[4] Professor Lupin later claimed that the atmosphere of excitement during a Quidditch Match would be like a feast to the Dementors, which they were unable to resist.\n\nTo overcome the Dementors, Harry asked Lupin for assistance. Lupin began teaching Harry the Patronus Charm, using a Boggart, which transformed into a Dementor in front of Harry. During the next Quidditch match Harry competed in, four Slytherins, Draco Malfoy, Vincent Crabbe, Gregory Goyle, and Marcus Flint, disguised themselves as Dementors to distract Harry. Although not yet capable of producing a fully formed Patronus, Harry was able to perform the spell well enough to thwart their attempts and won the match, after which Professor Minerva McGonagall sentenced the offending students to detention and deducted fifty House points from Slytherin, describing their stunt as \"an unworthy trick\" and \"a low and cowardly attempt to sabotage the Gryffindor seeker\".\n\nHarry's next encounter with the Dementors came when he, Hermione, and Sirius were attacked by a group of them in the Forbidden Forest; the three were saved by the intervention of a powerful and fully formed Patronus before the Dementors were able to take their souls via the Dementor's Kiss (defined below). Though initially believed (by Harry) to be the Patronus of his deceased father, this Patronus had in fact been conjured by Harry himself, who had travelled back in time with Hermione Granger using her Time-Turner[4] (this technically counts as both Harry's third and fourth encounter with the Dementors, since, due to his time travelling, he experienced this same encounter twice).\n\nHarry's Patronus took the form of a stag, which was both the form his father's Patronus took and the form his father took as an Animagus. Because the Dementors tried to Kiss Harry during this encounter in the Forest, it was enough to convince the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge to have the Dementors removed from Hogwarts at the end of the school year. Dumbledore seemed very happy about this.\n\nHarry met an apparent Dementor in the Triwizard Tournament. Thinking that it was a real Dementor, he conjured the Patronus Charm, but soon the Dementor stumbled, and then Harry knew it was a Boggart and soon used the Boggart-Banishing Spell.[citation needed]\n\nThat same evening, Fudge brought along a Dementor when he was notified that the Death Eater, Bartemius Crouch Junior, responsible for the activities that occurred was captured, for his own security, disregarding Minerva McGonagall's protest. The Dementor attacked the prisoner, who was also an escapee of Azkaban, on sight, sucking his soul out, which Fudge claimed it was no loss as he saw Crouch as a raving lunatic unworthy of bearing testimony. Dumbledore, who disapproved of this move, suggested Fudge to remove the Dementors from Azkaban to deprive Voldemort of their services, which Fudge thought to be absurd, as he did not believe Voldemort's return. He believed that even suggesting that the Azkaban guards be removed would result in him being impeached.\n\nHarry's fifth encounter was in an alley near his home on Privet Drive, when he and his cousin, Dudley Dursley, were ambushed by two Dementors sent secretly and illegally by Dolores Umbridge. He successfully used the Patronus Charm and was subsequently guided home by a Squib named Arabella Figg. Harry was put on trial for his use of underage magic in front of a Muggle (Dudley), but ultimately was not punished, as it was recognised as having been self-defence.\n\nNearly a year later, Umbridge admitted the plan to attack and undermine Harry using the Dementors.[11] The encounter also had the unintended side effect of prompting Dudley to begin to change his life for the better, after years of being a cruel, selfish bully, as his exposure to the Dementor's powers forced him to face these aspects of himself.[12]\n\nBy June 1996, all of the Dementors of Azkaban collectively rebelled against their employers to join Lord Voldemort, who offered them more victims and free rein across the country. This aided the 1996 and 1997 escapes of Death Eaters from Azkaban.[13] By mid-1996, the Dementors who had joined Voldemort were multiplying in such quantities as to generate an \"unseasonal\" July mist, noticeable to both the Muggle and wizarding worlds alike. Cornelius Fudge also admitted they were factors in the Prime Minister's recent decline in terms of public approval, as they were making people less happy in general.[14]\n\nAfter the Fall of the British Ministry of Magic, the Ministry once again counted on the Dementors when the Death Eaters took control of it. During the 1997 infiltration of the Ministry of Magic, while Harry Potter was disguised as Albert Runcorn, he encountered the Dementors in the Muggle-Born Registration Commission courtroom, where they were used to take away convicted Muggle-borns after interrogation and to terrorise them during interrogation. Dolores Umbridge protected herself and the other questioners with a Persian cat Patronus, which dissipated when Harry stunned her. Without Umbridge to control them, a Dementor attempted to give the Kiss to Mary Cattermole, the Muggle-born being interrogated at the time.[15]\n\nHarry saved Mary with his own Patronus which drove all of the Dementors in the courtroom into the corners due to its greater power than Umbridge's. Hermione cast a Patronus of her own, and she and Harry used their Patronuses to keep the Dementors in the courtroom and the hallway outside at bay so that they could rescue all of the remaining Muggle-borns. As the group left the area, Harry and Hermione left their Patronuses in the hallway to hold the Dementors at bay for as long as possible while they made their escape.[15]\n\nAfter Apparating to Hogsmeade, Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off a Caterwauling Charm and hid under Harry's Invisibility Cloak. Unable to find them, the Death Eaters dispatched Dementors to attack the trio, as Dementors sensed the presence of others and did not rely on sight. Harry was forced to cast his Patronus to protect the trio from being kissed. They could not Disapparate due to an Anti-Disapparition Jinx placed on the village and were stuck (caterwauling charm). Harry drove away the Dementors, but almost gave the three away, as his Patronus was very distinctive, Aberforth Dumbledore saved them and passed off Harry's stag as his own goat Patronus and ushered the trio into his pub.[16]\n\nLater, during the Battle of Hogwarts, the Dementors fought on the side of Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters. Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley were attacked by large numbers of Dementors, and due to the horrific events they had experienced and witnessed, including the recent death of Fred Weasley, they all had difficulty summoning their Patronuses.[17]\n\nIn fact, Harry welcomed the fate that came with a Dementor's kiss, but Seamus Finnigan, Luna Lovegood, and Ernie Macmillan attacked the Dementors with their own Patronuses holding them at bay and encouraged Harry to do the same, allowing him to finally summon his Patronus, which caused the Dementors to scatter.[17] Later, Harry encountered more Dementors in the Forbidden Forest, but the presence of James, Lily, Sirius and Remus, summoned through the Resurrection Stone, shielded him from them.[18]\n\nAfter the Second Wizarding War, the Ministry of Magic became headed by former-Auror and Order of the Phoenix member Kingsley Shacklebolt. Due to their actions during the war (allowing Death Eaters to escape back to Voldemort and joining forces with him themselves), Shacklebolt disbanded the Dementors as guards of Azkaban. After the Dementors were removed from the prison, Aurors were placed in the prison as guards instead.\n\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, a fearsome amount of Dementors attacked Hogwarts Castle. One of their first attacks was on Professor Longbottom and students while they were picking herbs at the edge of the Forbidden Forest. An attack on two students followed, which was fended off by Professor Flitwick. A Dementor also attacked Daniel Page in the greenhouses, but he was saved by Professor Flitwick as well.[3]\n\nSoon, the Dementors summoned other creatures to attack Hogwarts alongside them, and the professors had to put up a huge shield around the castle to defend against them, much like during the Battle of Hogwarts. The creatures still penetrated the shield regardless, and a big battle ensued. This battle was fought by Hogwarts staff and students. Harry Potter arrived late to the battle and ended it with a particularly powerful Patronus Charm.[3]\n\nIt was also after the Dementors were dismissed from Azkaban that one of them sided with Victor Gridley, who found it in a dark corner of London. Gridley later recruited another Dementor to help him in his criminal acts. They were locked in cages in the dungeon of his caravan, but could be released to engage in attacks. Gridley was able to control them using his wand, though this control immediately vanished, when his wand was broken by Daniel after he and his friends were thrown into the dungeon by Gridley in the same school year. Having already mastered the Patronus Charm, the students easily defended themselves from the Dementors.[3]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s or early 2020s, several Dementors appeared throughout the wizarding world to act as Confoundable guards to certain Foundables, including a young Harry Potter. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force had to cast the Patronus Charm to fend off these Dementors, allowing the Foundables to return to their rightful places. Harry Potter encountered one of these Dementor Confoundables in Wolverhampton, finding it attacking a younger version of himself and attempting to give the Foundable version of him the Dementor's Kiss. Harry managed to save his younger Foundable self and returned him to his original time. However, he later claimed that he couldn't get the image of him saving himself out of his mind.[19]\n\nA member of the task force training to become a professor also participated in an academic study on Dementors in order to try to understand them more completely. They were left with a seemingly never-ending sense of unease afterwards, but found themselves able to do more damage against dark forces in combat. A Calamity Investigator working for the task force later visited Azkaban with Dark Detectors to assess the level of inmate misbehaviour after reading a scathing Daily Prophet article regarding \"uncontrollable inmates\". Their investigation found that, while newer inmates were viciously scheming, the older inmates, who had previously been guarded by the Dementors, remained docile.[19]\n\nIn one of the alternate realities in which Scorpius Malfoy found himself, Voldemort had won the Battle of Hogwarts and was presiding over the school, with Dementors continuing under his service. Scorpius encountered the Dementors near the Great Lake at Hogwarts. The student saw these creatures on 22 October when he was caught by Dolores Umbridge, who was the headmistress of the school.[20]\n\nA week later, when Scorpius, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Severus Snape returned after making a change in the past, they were found by Dementors. Since Hermione and Ron were wanted by arrest warrant, they decided to stay to give the remaining time to save themselves. Ron tried to conjure a patronus, but Hermione stopped him to sacrifice herself and keep these creatures there. The Dementors quickly found them and drained their souls.\n\nSnape left with Scorpius and encouraged him so that the boy would not give in to the despair spread by these creatures. Soon they met Umbridge, who recognised that Snape was working against her and Voldemort, but was rejected by his spell. Then the Dementors attacked, but Severus conjured up a Patronus and promised to keep them as long as possible to ensure that Scorpius could escape. Malfoy ran in the trail of a silver doe, and Snape was deprived of his soul by these creatures. The Patronus kept Scorpius safe long enough to reach the Great Lake and set things right.[21]\n\nDementors had a humanoid shape, approximately 4 metres, or 12 feet high, and were covered in long robes and hooded cloaks of ripped black cloth, making them closely resemble wraiths. Their skins were grey, slimy, and decayed-looking, like a decomposing corpse. Their breathing emitted a rattling sound, like it was trying to \"suck more than air\" out of a room. Their hands were \"glistening, greyish, slimy-looking, and scabbed\". They seemed to exude an aura of cold. When in a cluster, Dementors appeared as a foul mist.[22]\n\nA Dementor's face, which is usually completely hidden by their deep hoods, had empty eye sockets, covered with thin, scabbed skin. There was a gaping large hole where the mouth should've been, which was used for consuming the positive emotions of humans, as well as for sucking the soul out of the victim in a process called the Dementor's Kiss, leaving victims in a state generally considered worse than death. The Dementor pulled back its hood and sucked out its victim's soul, leaving the person an empty shell, alive but completely, irretrievably \"gone\". They were described as being able to glide over the ground only, and in any case, they couldn't pass through solid obstacles.[4]\n\nDementors were also known to be blind, as they did not have eyes. However, they could sense whether a presence was near them or not, by sensing the victim's emotions. This sense appeared to have been extremely acute, as the Dementors stationed at the entrances to Hogwarts Castle were able to sense the presence of Sirius Black walking beside the Great Lake in his human form. (It is interesting to note that many witches and wizards, including Hermione Granger, appeared to have had a misconception that Dementors were capable of vision, for instance, when Hermione proclaimed her certainty that the Dementors stationed at the entrances to Hogwarts would have seen Sirius fly into the school.)\n\nDementors seemed to suck all the light, sound, and happiness from the air as they drew long rattling breaths, and caused darkness to close in everywhere and the victim to feel incredibly cold. They could glide towards a victim with no sound other than then sounds of their own rattling sucking. However, this magically enforced darkness could be lit up by the Lumos Charm, as well as by the silver light of Patronuses.\n\nTheir sapience was heavily debated: they were sentient enough to taste and sense fear, being drawn to it and the promise of positive memories that it could feed off of. They were also intelligent enough to bargain: they obeyed the British Ministry of Magic for years because, in guarding Azkaban, they were provided with the sustenance of any remaining hope or happiness in the prisoners.\n\nThey could understand and follow at least simple instructions, which allowed Dementors to act as a bodyguard to Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge in 1995,[7] to bury dead prisoners in the prison grounds, and to escort prisoners in and out of the Muggle-Born Registration Commission courtroom in 1997.[15] They could also communicate what they had heard Sirius Black saying in his sleep to the Ministry in 1993, and comment on his \"less human, less complex\" state of mind (in his Animagus form), implying that they could speak or otherwise communicate with wizards.\n\nOn the other hand, Albus Dumbledore described Dementors as savage creatures unable to differentiate between who they pursued and who stood in their way. He also informed the students to give Dementors no reason to harm them, saying that forgiveness and mercy were \"not in the nature of a Dementor\". Despite their having made bargains with humans - first with the Ministry of Magic, then with Voldemort - they seem to have had difficulty keeping these bargains in mind, as shown when, upon the Stunning of Dolores Umbridge by Harry Potter, the Dementors in the room immediately abandoned restraint and attempted to kiss Mary Cattermole, apparently heedless of possible retaliations or repercussions from the wizards.  Moreover, they had no soul of their own.\n\nOutside of Azkaban, Dementors appeared to hunt for prey in groups of variable size, from as small as two to as large as greater than twenty. They appeared to attack by first surrounding their targets, cutting off any escape, then descending upon them all at once to feed. Ironically enough, however, in rare cases, Dementors had been shown forming a bond with a wizard and obeying their orders.[23]\n\nOne notable example was Midas Gullveig, an illegal loan shark of the 21st century, who formed a bond with a Dementor during his years at Hogwarts. That Dementor, and later others, obeyed him ever since the bond had been made. However, at one point, he was close to defeating a Hogwarts student Wénshī Scrivenshaft in a duel and became overcome with happiness, attracting his Dementors and eventually receiving the Dementor's Kiss himself.[23]\n\nThey were genderless and did not mate, and they grew like fungus where there was decay. After Morfin Gaunt and Bartemius Crouch Jnr's mother died in Azkaban, Dementors buried their bodies, which showed that Dementors were capable of physical labour, such as grave-digging. Also, Sirius escaped when the Dementors came to give food, another sort of labour.\n\nMuggles could not see Dementors, only wizards could.[24] It is unknown if other magical beings, like goblins and house-elves could see them. It was under debate if Squibs were able to see Dementors. While Arabella Figg had claimed in the Wizengamot court room to have seen the Dementors that had attacked Harry and Dudley in Little Whinging,[24] it was later confirmed that she had lied. It was unclear if she was unable to see the Dementors or if she was merely arriving late at the scene.[25]\n\nDementors literally fed on the positive emotions of human beings in order to survive, sucking away every happy thought and pleasant memory. Once someone had been drained of happiness, they were left with only their worst experiences, which bubbled up to the surface. Their victims were forced to relive their worst memories over and over again, making them feel like they'd never be happy again. Naturally, this was much worse for people who had genuine horrors and tragedies in their past. This was what made Dementors such effective prison guards, as they were able to keep prisoners in a constant state of hopelessness.\n\nThe very presence of a Dementor could make the victim's surrounding atmosphere grow cold and dark, and as the number of Dementors increased, so did the effects. Those that were kept in the company of a Dementor for too long tended to become depressed, and were often driven insane, which was the main source of Azkaban's well-deserved horrible reputation when they still guarded its prisoners. After spending only a few months there, Rubeus Hagrid claimed he wished he would die in his sleep.[4] For this reason, they were considered some of the foulest creatures on earth.\n\nIt was stated by Remus Lupin that, if a wizard remained in close contact with Dementors for an extended period of time, a Dementor could drain a wizard of his powers. This fact was not expounded upon, so the truth to this statement was unknown. If this was the case, however, it would make Dementors the only known being to permanently render a wizard without magic. Lupin might also have meant this metaphorically, as severe depression, which was caused by prolonged contact with Dementors, could be really detrimental to a wizard's ability to cast spells. Muggles were affected in a way similar to wizards and witches, becoming depressed when Dementors were nearby.\n\nBeing blind, Dementors relied fully on their ability to sense emotion and physical and/or mental health to track the movements of the prisoners in their care, and were generally unable to distinguish one person from another if both were in similar physical or mental condition. They were unable to identify Mrs Crouch being sneaked into Azkaban disguised as Bartemius Crouch Jnr using Polyjuice Potion, or Barty Crouch Jnr being sneaked out disguised as his mother, since both were ill nearly to the point of death, as divulged by Bartemius Crouch Jnr under the influence of Veritaserum in 1995 (though it may be that they simply did not care whom they were sucking happiness from so long as they were \"fed\").\n\nOn the other hand, Dementors seemingly didn't feel and recognise animal emotions in the same way as human emotions. When Sirius Black, an Animagus, was imprisoned in Azkaban and secretly changed into his dog form (before his eventual successful escape, also as a dog), his emotions were less human. The Dementors could feel there was a difference in his emotions when he changed his form, but they didn't understand why there was such a difference; they simply thought he was losing his mind.\n\nIn addition to feeding on positive emotions, Dementors could perform their last and most dangerous ability: the Dementor's Kiss, in which a Dementor pulled up its hood, latched its mouth onto a victim's mouth, and literally sucked out the person's soul.[4] The British Ministry of Magic occasionally allowed this as a punishment, before Kingsley Shacklebolt became Minister for Magic.\n\nThe person was still alive since the heart and brain would still continue to function, but without their soul, the victim had no memory, awareness, or sense of self. They were left an empty shell, incapable of thought and with no possibility of recovery. It was believed that existing after a Dementor's Kiss was worse than death: as a person's soul was their true self, to be \"kissed\" by a Dementor was to cease to exist, and yet also remain. If someone's soul was sucked out, they were unable to come back as a ghost, as it was necessary for a person to have a soul for that. It was also possible that the soul was trapped inside the Dementor, thus the victim was unable to pass on. This was probably what \"worse than death\" meant. It was unknown what effect a Dementor's Kiss would have had on a person who had split his or her soul through the use of a Horcrux.\n\nThe only known named victim of the kiss was Barty Crouch Jnr. From 1994 to 1995, Crouch had been using Polyjuice Potion to pose as Alastor Moody and had been teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts in his stead. He was detained at the castle, awaiting trial, after his ploy was discovered, and it was revealed that he had been working in secret for Voldemort. He was subjected to the punishment by a Dementor accompanying Cornelius Fudge as a bodyguard.[7] The unfortunate consequence of this act was that it rendered Crouch unable to testify about his master's return, allowing Voldemort almost a full year to gather strength while the Ministry continued in its denial.\n\nNo one had ever demonstrated the ability to kill a Dementor, by Avada Kedavra or otherwise, implying that they couldn't be killed through physical means, but could only be driven away or temporarily kept at bay. One of the few ways to shield oneself from Dementors was by the very difficult Patronus Charm.[4] The charm summoned a Patronus, a magical manifestation of good will and happiness, providing varied levels of protection against the Dementors' influence, based on the caster's strength as a wizard. With sufficient ability, a single wizard could hold off dozens, if not hundreds, of Dementors with a single corporeal Patronus. Harry Potter demonstrated this during his third year at Hogwarts when he drove off a horde of Dementors seeking to consume Hermione Granger, Sirius Black, and Harry's past selves.[4]\n\nAs the Patronus was not alive, the Dementor couldn't feed on it. Only when summoned by an experienced caster would the Patronus take the form of an animal significant in some way to the individual. While a lower level Patronus was more amorphous and ephemeral, corporeal Patronuses chased down Dementors and forced them to flee the vicinity.[26] An incorporeal Patronus only slowed a Dementor down,[4] as if the creature was walking through quicksand, and tended not to last long, but could eventually give the caster time to escape.\n\nDark wizards couldn't commonly produce Patronuses. However, they did not need to do so in the first place, as they were like-minded in evil. Voldemort even stated that they were natural allies. This did not, however, prevent Dementors from imprisoning and feeding on Dark wizards in Azkaban.\n\nSince Dementors couldn't properly sense the less complex thoughts and emotions of a person when they took on an Animagus form, doing so allowed some, such as Sirius Black, to temporarily avoid feeling the effects of the Dementors' presence.[4] When they sensed the less-than-human thoughts of his Animagus form, the Dementors simply thought Sirius was losing his mind.\n\nThe effects of a Dementor's happiness-draining powers could also be resisted if one focused not on happy thoughts, but on obsessions, or other things that gave one strength without exactly making one feel better. For example, Sirius managed to avoid going mad in the Dementors' custody and eventually plan an escape by focusing on the fact that he was innocent and didn't belong in Azkaban, and later that Peter Pettigrew was at Hogwarts and that Harry was in danger. However, this feat was mostly attributed to the fact of him being an Animagus who was able to temporarily avoid feeling the effects of the Dementors' presence in his animal form.\n\nThough clearly not a common method of repelling Dementors, the enigmatic form people took after being brought back by the Resurrection Stone appeared to function much like a Patronus, as the \"resurrected\" forms of Sirius Black, Remus Lupin, and James and Lily Potter were able to shield Harry Potter from the Dementors that Voldemort had stationed in the Forbidden Forest on 2 May 1998.[18] Also, after Harry returned from the brink of life and death, he was so overcome with joy at being alive that the Dementors had no effect on him, showing that if a person was truly happy, the Dementors' main weapon was rendered useless.[27]\n\nThere may have been another, more common way of repelling and defending against a Dementor, aside from the Patronus Charm, as Remus Lupin stated that there were certain defences against Dementors.[4] Also, Harry Potter disagreed with Professor Severus Snape on the best method for confronting one in Defence Against the Dark Arts when it was the subject of a report in his sixth-year.[28] This implies that there were, indeed, other methods. The spell Protego horribilis may have been one such method, as it was cast around Hogwarts Castle shortly prior to the Battle of Hogwarts, and no Dementors were reported to be present on the school grounds before the fall of the spell.\n\nThe mood-enhancing properties of chocolate were well known in both the Muggle and wizarding worlds. Chocolate was the perfect antidote for anyone who had been overcome in the presence of Dementors, which sucked hope and happiness out of their surroundings. Chocolate could only be a short-term remedy, however. Finding ways to fight off Dementors — or depression — were essential if one was to become permanently happier. Excessive chocolate consumption couldn't benefit either Muggle or wizard.[29]\n\nThe word dementor may derive from the Latin dēmens, meaning \"insane\", combined with the suffix -or, indicating \"one who performs an action\", meaning \"one who drives someone to insanity\". Alternatively, dementor could combine the prefix de- (indicating removal), the root mens (mind or soul), and the suffix -or, meaning \"remover of one's soul\" or \"one who turns someone mindless\".\n\nIn the film series, Dementors are portrayed differently compared to how they were described in the books. In the books, they were described as tall hooded humanoid figures, whereas in the films, they appear as skeletal creatures wearing black robes.\n\nAnother notable difference is that the Dementors in the films can fly freely. This aspect was completely absent from the books, where they were merely gliding over the ground. This is most noticeable when the Dementors were intruding the first Quidditch match in the Prisoner of Azkaban. In the book, the Dementors were described as standing in the stadium, while in the film, they were purposefully pursuing a broomstick-riding Harry Potter. Because of this, the corporeal Patronus Charm in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban seems to work differently by sending a pulse at the Dementors flying in the air rather than charging at them on the ground.\n\nFurthermore, the Dementors from the films appear to have a much more drastic effect on the environment compared to their book counterparts. In the films, the nearby surroundings of a Dementor are immediately covered by a layer of ice and any plant in the vicinity almost instantly withers away. The only explicit effect the book described Dementors were having in the environment is that they are accompanied by a cold mist. The first Dementor Harry encountered in the third film was able to open the Hogwarts Express without touching it, causing it to slide open with a wave of its hand, with some wizards and witches in the films also being able to perform similar feats. Also, the first Dementor seen in the fifth film was able to effortlessly lift Harry off the ground by the neck and pin him to a wall, showing great strength.\n\nThe following languages are the same as the original:",
