  "content": "A Boggart was an amortal shape-shifting non-being that took on the form of its observer's worst fear. Because of their shape-shifting ability, no one knew what a Boggart looked like when it was alone, as it changed shape instantly upon encountering someone.[1][2]\n\nWhen facing a Boggart, it was best to have someone else along, to try to confuse it, since facing more than one person at once made it indecisive towards determining what form it should take, usually resulting in an unfrightening combination of the victims' fears.[1][2]\n\nBoggarts would, at least before the Battle of Hogwarts, very commonly appear as Lord Voldemort, since he represented the worst fear of many wizards and witches.[5]\n\nNobody knew what a Boggart looked like if nobody was there to see it, although it continued to exist, usually giving evidence of its presence by rattling, shaking or scratching the object in which it is hiding. Boggarts particularly liked confined spaces, but may also have been found lurking in woods and around shadowy corners.[2]\n\nMuch like Poltergeists, Boggart were non-beings, who, although they resembled living creatures, were not considered magically \"alive\" and were as a result amortal. A Boggart could be made to disappear with the Boggart-Banishing Spell, but more would inevitably arise to take their place. Much like Poltergeists with mischief and Dementors with gloom and depression, Boggarts seemed to embody the human emotion of fear, and consequently feed on other beings' fears.[2]\n\nBoggarts' ability to shapeshift showed remarkable speed and fluidity, but had several limitations. Firstly, being confined, if nothing else, by the size of the room it inhabited, the Boggart would scale down an otherwise-gigantic form (as seen when a Boggart turned into the full moon).[1] Secondly, though a Boggart who transformed into a magical being or object could replicate its abilities to an extent, this would be a weaker facsimile of the real thing; thus, a Boggart transformed into a Dementor had weaker magic than a real Dementor (according to Professor Lupin, who exploited this effect to simulate a Dementor attack in Harry's presence to help him perfect the use of the Patronus Charm at no serious risk to Harry Potter's soul).[6]\n\nAdditionally, when a witch or wizard had multiple fears that tied for their \"worst,\" the Boggart would typically cycle through those fears, presumably randomly. For example, in August 1995, when Molly Weasley was attempting to banish a Boggart that had taken up residence in 12 Grimmauld Place, the Boggart took the form of the freshly dead bodies of her family, as well as Harry Potter, whom she loved like a son. Since she feared the deaths of all her loved ones equally, the Boggart cycled through all the corpses randomly.[7]\n\nThe extent of Boggarts' intelligence was unclear; though they sometimes took the forms of sentient beings as part of their fear-inducing transformations;[1][8] those false \"people\" appeared to be little more than caricatures, acting out the motions of the victim's fear involving said people, heedless of their surroundings.[8][9] It was worth noting however that one Boggart once settled into the form of a human killer, foregoing individual transformations, and successfully posed as this man for a long period of time; and Boggarts' closest-known \"relatives\", Poltergeists and Dementors, both possessed sapience.[2]\n\nThough they could not see other non-beings like Dementors, Muggles could sometimes see Boggarts; however, as most Muggles refused to acknowledge anything that might even be considered somewhat magical, the glimpses they caught of Boggarts were usually dismissed as mere hallucinations or figments of the viewer's imagination. This denial was helped by the fact that Muggles rarely saw Boggarts plainly, due to their favoured haunts being dark places away from the public eye.[2]\n\nBoggarts were capable of leaving a dark presence in spaces they once inhabited, that could be felt by humans.[4]\n\nWhen taking the form of something that could do magic, Boggarts were able to cast spells, though the extent of this is unclear. When a Boggart took the form of Lord Voldemort during the 1986–1987 school year, Jacob's sibling first had to duel it before they were able to cast Riddikulus and banish it.[10]\n\nThe incantation for the Boggart-Banishing Spell was Riddikulus. The charm required a strong mind and good concentration. The incantation and wand movement alone would not affect a Boggart. The spell could be tricky, because it involved making the creature into a figure of fun, so that fear could be dispelled in amusement. If the caster was able to laugh aloud at the Boggart, it would disappear at once. The intention was to force the Boggart to assume a less-threatening and hopefully comical form.[1][2]\n\nIn September 1993, this charm was taught by Remus Lupin during a third-year Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[1]\n\nHaving multiple people facing one Boggart may have reduced its effectiveness of frightening its victims, since it would not have been able to determine which form to take.[1]\n\nA Boggart also gained the weaknesses of whatever they turned into. For example if it turned into a Dementor, it could be repelled by a Patronus Charm like a normal Dementor.[6] A Boggart in the form of a Dementor could also trip over its robes, revealing its true nature.[11]\n\nBoggarts were particularly fond of inhabiting dark, confined spaces, such as in wardrobes, the gap beneath beds, and the cupboards under sinks and desks.[2] On at least one occasion, a Boggart was found hiding in a grandfather clock.[1] They also liked shadowy corners.[2]\n\nFamous Boggarts included the Old Boggle of Canterbury, believed by local Muggles to be a mad, cannibalistic hermit that lived in a cave; in reality a particularly small Boggart that had learnt how to make the most of echoes.[2]\n\nThe Bludgeoning Boggart of Old London Town, that had taken on the form of a murderous thug that prowled the back streets of 19th century London, but could be reduced to a hamster with one simple incantation.[2]\n\nScottish Screaming Bogey of Strathtully, that had fed on the fears of local Muggles to the point that it had become an elephantine black shadow with glowing white eyes, but which Lyall Lupin of the British Ministry of Magic eventually trapped in a matchbox.[2]\n\nThere was an old cupboard in a room in Hogwarts Castle containing a powerful Boggart that five professors had to defeat. They were barely able to repel it as it shifted between various forms, including a werewolf, tornado, a plate of haggis, a Hungarian Horntail and someone's mother-in-law.[12]\n\nNear the end of the 1890–1891 school year, fifth-year students trained in repelling Boggarts under the supervision of Professor Dinah Hecat. During the lesson, Natsai Onai saw the Boggart turn into an unidentified adult man, and used the Boggart-Banishing Spell to change it into an inoffensive cat.[13]\n\nIn the 1910s, Professor Albus Dumbledore taught students how to confront a Boggart and learn the spell to banish it. When Newt Scamander's Boggart turned into a desk, Dumbledore commented on its unexpected nature and kindly inquired why it took this form. Newt confessed that his greatest fear was being stuck working in an office. After Newt successfully dispatched the Boggart, Dumbledore encouraged Leta Lestrange to take her turn. Dumbledore reassured Leta that being afraid of something wasn't shameful. The form of Leta's Boggart surprised both Dumbledore and the entire class: a white sheet containing an indistinguishable, slight form floating through a dark blue glow. The event badly shook Leta.[14]\n\nAt some point during his time at Hogwarts, Jacob opened the Vault of Fear, releasing the Boggarts that guarded it onto the school grounds. Once he resealed the vault, the Boggarts were again locked away.\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, the Vault of Fear was again tampered with, which caused a large number of Boggarts to appear in an unusually high frequency around the school. One incident involved a Boggart appearing in a greenhouse during a Herbology class, scaring Penny Haywood.[15] Jacob's sibling learned from Rubeus Hagrid that Boggarts had not been seen on the school ground's since Jacob's school days.[16] Jacob's sibling learnt from one of Jacob's notebooks that the Boggarts were active due to Vault of Fear having been tampered with.[17] Jacob's sibling learnt the Boggart-Banishing Spell with Tulip Karasu, and defeated two Boggarts with it; one in the Artefact Room for Tulip, and another in Jacob's room.[9] After Jacob's sibling and friends opened the vault and defeated the Boggarts guarding it, the curse was broken and Boggarts stopped appearing so often.[18][19]\n\nAlso during this year, a Boggart caused panic that Lord Voldemort was returning when Ben Copper mistook the Boggart for the real thing. Jacob's sibling eventually tracked the Boggart down and defeated it, but only after it had terrified the residents of Hogsmeade.[10]\n\nDuring the 1988–1989 school year, Professor Patricia Rakepick taught her fifth-year Defence Against the Dark Arts students about how to defend against a Boggart. She instructed Jacob's sibling to give a demonstration. A Boggart in the form of Lord Voldemort rose from the chest, and was defeated by Jacob's sibling.[20]\n\nIn 1993, Professor Remus Lupin taught his third-year Defence Against the Dark Arts students about how to defend against a Boggart. He took the class to the staffroom, where a Boggart had moved into a wardrobe the previous afternoon. After explaining what they would need to do, Professor Lupin let the class, starting with Neville Longbottom, perform the Riddikulus charm on the Boggart. When the Boggart moved towards Harry Potter, Lupin drew the Boggart's attention, causing it to turn into a full moon (as he was in fact a werewolf), then had Neville finish it off, banishing it for good.[1]\n\nLater, Professor Lupin explained that the reason he didn't let Harry face the Boggart was that he thought Harry's Boggart would turn into Lord Voldemort, and he didn't want to panic the students.[21] Harry's Boggart actually took on the form of a Dementor,[6] as he had an encounter with them on the way to Hogwarts that year and heard his mother's dying moments whenever they came near.[22]\n\nTo help Harry, Professor Lupin taught him how to perform the Patronus, using a Boggart found in Argus Filch's filing cabinet as a substitute for a real Dementor. In between the private lessons, Professor Lupin kept the Boggart in a cabinet under the desk, in his office.[6]\n\nAt the end of the school year, Lupin used another Boggart as part of his third year exams, as the final obstacle in a series.[8]\n\nOn 24 June 1995, Harry Potter came across a Boggart in the Triwizard Maze during the Third Task of the Triwizard Tournament of that year, in the form of a Dementor. Harry initially thought the Boggart was actually a Dementor, thus casting his Patronus, and realised that the creature was in fact a Boggart when it fell back and tripped over the hem of its robes instead of being driven back, as a real Dementor would have done.[11]\n\nDuring the 2008–2009 school year, Professor Kate Brindlemore taught her first-year Defence Against the Dark Arts students how to repel Boggarts. A Boggart also existed in one of the cupboards in the Headmaster's office, which some students unleashed due to wanting to use the Pensieve in the cupboard. It was faced by Daniel Page first and changed into a dragon, and later into an evil version of Ivy Warrington herself when she faced it.[23]\n\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, a Boggart was present in Neville Longbottom's storeroom, which changed into the form of a masked wizard from NOTME when it was discovered by Linderina Crane, letting her believe it was a real wizard. She cast the Incarcerous Spell on the Boggart, but it remained unharmed and started to cast spells towards her. When students came to the rescue, two more masked wizard Boggarts appeared.[23]\n\nAfter they were almost defeated, when Daniel Page faced a Boggart, it changed into the form of his mother Kaleena being an Azkaban convict. Realising that it could help him see his mother again, Daniel went back to the room some time later and listened to the Boggart talk. His friend then arrived and faced the Boggart themself, making it turn into an Acromantula, and cast the Boggart-Banishing Spell which gave the Boggart roller skates.[23]\n\nWhile cleaning up 12 Grimmauld Place, the new headquarters of the reconvened Order of the Phoenix, Molly Weasley stumbled across what she thought was a Boggart in a locked cabinet of a writing desk. She decided to wait for Alastor Moody to confirm it was a Boggart, before opening the cabinet.[24]\n\nAfter escaping from the party being held in celebration of Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger becoming Prefects, Harry heard sobbing coming from the drawing room. When he looked inside, Harry saw Mrs Weasley cowering against a dark wall, and the body of her son, Ron, sprawled on the floor. After Molly tried the Riddikulus charm without success, Ron's body turned into the body of Bill Weasley, with his eyes wide open and empty. Molly's next attempt turned Bill's body into Arthur Weasley, with blood running down his face. The next attempts turned the Boggart into Fred and George Weasley, Percy Weasley, and then Harry.[7]\n\nHarry shouted to Mrs Weasley that she should leave, causing Remus Lupin and Sirius Black to run into the room, followed by Alastor Moody. Lupin quickly figured out what had happened, and made the Boggart turn from Harry's dead body to the full moon, then with a wave of his wand, made the orb vanish in a puff of smoke.[7]\n\nAlthough the precise details of this encounter are unknown, Lupin mentioned during his first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson in 1993 that he had once had an encounter with a Boggart in the company of at least two other people where the Boggart, attempting to frighten two people at once, turned itself into half a slug (One person was afraid of a Flesh-Eating Slug and the other was afraid of headless corpses).[1]\n\nThe following individuals all had Voldemort as their Boggart form, and after performing the Boggart-Banishing Spell, Lord Voldemort would turn into a baby and suck on a dummy:[5]\n\nIn English mythology, a Boggart (or bogart, bogan, bogle or boggle) is a household spirit, sometimes mischievous, sometimes helpful.",
