  "content": "The Hungarian Horntail was a species of dragon native to Hungary, which was considered to be one of the most dangerous dragon breeds, if not the most dangerous.[2] It possessed black scales, a spiked tail, and was lizard-like in appearance.[1]\n\nIt had black scales, and was lizard-like in appearance. It also had yellow eyes, with vertical pupils like a cat's, bronze horns and similarly coloured spikes that protruded from its long tail which it would gladly deploy in combat.[1]\n\nThe dragon's roar was a yowling, screeching scream, and its flame could reach to about fifty feet. While having a very far reaching flame, the Horntail's breath could reach extremely high temperatures, as it made a stone turn red hot in seconds.[3] Its eggs were cement-coloured and particularly hard-shelled.[3] The Horntail's foods of choice included cattle, sheep, goats, and whenever possible, humans.[1]\n\nHorntails were also known for being one of the most vicious and aggressive breeds of dragon, and that was saying something since all dragons were known to be ferocious; Charlie Weasley commented on their ferocity, saying that the Horntail was a \"vicious thing\",[2] and even Rubeus Hagrid regarded it as a \"right nasty piece of work\".[4] This breed was especially aggressive when protecting their young.[3] Young ones were noted to be quicker and more vicious, making them even more dangerous.[5]\n\nAlong with their viciousness, tail spikes, and fiery breath, Horntails were shown being extremely fast in flight, as the one Harry fought in the Triwizard Tournament was able to keep up with his Firebolt, a broomstick that was capable of going from 0 to 150 miles per hour in ten seconds, and was also able to keep up with his flying skills, a very impressive feat considering Harry's talent as a seeker.[3]\n\nA Hungarian Horntail was the guardian of the Buried Vault, one of the Cursed Vaults. At the end of the 1988–1989 school year, it was defeated by Jacob's sibling.[6]\n\nAt some point before or during the 1989–1990 school year, a Hungarian Horntail mistook Urgruff's egg as one of her own. She later encountered Bill Weasley and his friends at the Romanian Dragon Sanctuary and fought them, but was unable to keep the egg.[7]\n\nDuring the First Task of the 1994 Triwizard Tournament, a Hungarian Horntail, alongside a Common Welsh Green, Chinese Fireball, and Swedish Short-Snout, was selected as obstacles of Golden egg retrieval for the Champions. Harry Potter ended up drawing the Hungarian Horntail to face.[3] Later before Christmas, when faced with the agony of trying to ask someone to the Yule Ball, Harry said that he would have preferred facing the Horntail again.[8]",
