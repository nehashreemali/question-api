  "content": "Buckbeak,[4] later renamed Witherwings,[2] was a male Hippogriff. He lived with Rubeus Hagrid during Harry Potter's third year at Hogwarts, along with a few other hippogriffs.[4]\n\nHe was later unfairly sentenced to death, when he attacked Draco Malfoy after being taunted and provoked. Though the attack was Draco’s fault for not listening to Hagrid, Buckbeak's death sentence was delivered from the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures. Many of the members of this committee had been threatened by Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy, into voting for that verdict.[7]\n\nWith the help of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and her Time-Turner, Buckbeak escaped execution in 1994 and he came under the care of Sirius Black.[9] Sirius kept Buckbeak with him while on the run during the 1994–1995 school year, and later kept him in his mother's bedroom while in hiding at 12 Grimmauld Place.[10]\n\nAfter Sirius's death, Buckbeak came to be owned by Harry Potter through Sirius's will, though Harry allowed him to live with Hagrid. He participated in two battles of the Second Wizarding War, most notably the Battle of Hogwarts.[6] He also showed great affection and loyalty toward Harry,[4] defending him whenever he was in danger.[8]\n\nIn September 1993, Rubeus Hagrid brought his first Care of Magical Creatures class to see and study Buckbeak, as well as other hippogriffs. Under Hagrid's direction, Harry was able to successfully approach Buckbeak and was even allowed to ride him for a short flight around the paddock.[4]\n\nAs hippogriffs were immensely proud creatures, Buckbeak was offended when Draco Malfoy taunted and provoked him. This resulted in him injuring the boy's arm.[4] Draco's father, Lucius Malfoy insisted that the Hippogriff be put to death.[7] Malfoy's influence in the Ministry of Magic led to his views being the majority vote, and the execution was to be carried out. Walden Macnair, an executioner, came to Hogwarts as the employed executioner, and Buckbeak was tied in Hagrid's pumpkin patch to await his death.[11]\n\nHowever, using a Time-Turner, Harry Potter and Hermione Granger rescued Buckbeak just prior to the execution.[9] Originally, they had heard the swish of an axe and assumed Buckbeak had been killed.[11] Later, as it became evident that Buckbeak had escaped, Macnair was frustrated upon realising Buckbeak had gone and so swung his axe into the fence of Hagrid's hut in frustration. He was then happily dismissed by Albus Dumbledore.\n\nHermione and Harry took Buckbeak into the Forbidden Forest with them to remain hidden from sight, and Hermione tied him to a tree to stop him escaping. As Hermione and Harry realised Remus Lupin in his werewolf form was entering the forest, they went inside Hagrid's hut to hide. Hermione stayed in the hut with Buckbeak, who was very happy to be back home again. Harry then went off to the Black Lake to fight the Dementors with the Patronus Charm in order to save his and Hermione's past selves and Sirius Black.\n\nAfter this, Hermione took Buckbeak with her to see what was going on in the forest. Buckbeak was then used to fly to Filius Flitwick's office, in which Sirius was locked up, enabling Black to escape the Dementors and leave Hogwarts.[9]\n\nSirius Black then took possession of Buckbeak while both were on the run from the Ministry of Magic. Buckbeak stayed in Sirius's late mother's room at 12 Grimmauld Place.[10]\n\nOn 6 March 1995, Buckbeak appeared with Sirius in the cave near Hogsmeade when he came to talk to Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley.[5]\n\nOn 18 June 1996, Kreacher injured Buckbeak with the encouragement of Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy so that Sirius would be occupied with taking care of him when Harry tried to contact him. This led Harry to believe a false vision Lord Voldemort showed him in which Sirius was being tortured in the Department of Mysteries. The scene lured Harry and his friends to the Ministry and set the stage for a battle. During the battle, Sirius died, knocked through the Veil in the Death Chamber by Bellatrix.[12]\n\nIn July 1996, a month after Sirius' death, Albus Dumbledore told Harry that, according to Sirius' will, he was now the legal owner of Buckbeak, though Harry told Dumbledore that Buckbeak could continue living with Rubeus Hagrid.\n\nIn order to protect the hippogriff's identity, Buckbeak was renamed \"Witherwings\" at this time.[2][3] He was greeted by Harry in front of Hagrid's hut when the trio dropped in for a visit.[13] He was also present near the hut during Aragog's funeral.[14]\n\nOn 30 June 1997, Buckbeak joined Harry's duel with Severus Snape across the grounds, attacking Snape and driving him off, thus protecting Harry. Buckbeak survived the battle and was still in very good health.[8]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts, Buckbeak, along with several Thestrals, was seen attacking Lord Voldemort's giant soldiers from the air while Grawp hit them. Buckbeak survived the battle.[6]\n\nBuckbeak was still alive and well by 2008. During a Christmas season at Hogwarts, he stayed with Hagrid, who invited students to ride him around the castle.[15]\n\nDuring a Calamity surge focused on the denizens of the Forbidden Forest in July 2019, Buckbeak was turned into a Foundable. Calamity Investigators working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force managed to safely return Buckbeak back to his proper place in the forest, much to the relief of Hagrid.[16]\n\nBuckbeak was a proud creature and at first he seemed to be fairly aggressive, attacking Draco Malfoy when the latter insulted him.[4] Despite his earlier signs of aggression, Buckbeak has been shown to be very loyal and protective of those who treat him with kindness and respect.[4][9][8]\n\nBuckbeak was intelligent in his ability to recognise his past acquaintances, as he defended a cornered Harry from Severus Snape in 1997.[8] His loyalty towards Harry was undying, and further proven when he joined the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998 to fight.[6]",
