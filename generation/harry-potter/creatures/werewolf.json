  "content": "A werewolf, also known as a lycanthrope, was a creature which normally resembled a human being but, upon the complete rising of the full moon, became an uncontrollable, fearsome and deadly wolf.[1] This condition was caused by infection with lycanthropy, also known as werewolfry.[6] Werewolves were almost indistinguishable in appearance from the true wolf. The real difference was in behaviour.[1]\n\nA mixture of powdered silver and dittany applied to a fresh werewolf bite would seal the wound and allow the victim to live on as a werewolf, although tragic tales were told of bite victims begging for death rather than becoming werewolves. The Wolfsbane Potion, invented by Damocles Belby, allowed werewolf drinkers to keep their human mind during transformation.[1]\n\nA werewolf could not choose whether or not to transform and would no longer remember who they were once transformed and were very aggressive; multiple werewolves were known to kill their best friends or loved ones while in wolf form if they were given the chance. Despite this, they were able to recall everything they had experienced throughout their transformation upon reverting to their human form.\n\nLycanthropy was a magical illness known to be spread by contact between saliva and blood; thus, when a transformed werewolf bit a human, the bitten would become a werewolf themselves.[1] These bites, however, could also be fatal, and a mixture of silver and dittany applied to the fresh wound would seal it and allow the person to live on as a werewolf. Specifically Muggles would die from the extent of their injuries if their wounds were not sealed, as noted by Professor Marlowe Forfang, though some could survive to become werewolves themselves.[1] Cecil Lee, an employee of the Werewolf Capture Unit in the British Ministry of Magic, believed that werewolves were ultimately victims of a curse, although it is worth noting that Lee was relatively inexperienced in the area of curses.[7]\n\nWere a werewolf in human form when they bit their victim, the victim would merely gain lupine tendencies such as a fondness for raw meat. Any bite or scratch obtained from a werewolf, whether in human or animal form, would leave permanent scars, even if the wound was sealed.[1]\n\nAccording to Remus Lupin, werewolves rarely have children.[8] This is likely due to fears, as expressed by Lupin himself, that any children would inherit their affliction, with the danger and prejudice that comes with it. The only known human born to at least one werewolf parent (untransformed at time of conception) was Teddy Lupin, son of werewolf Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks.\n\nDespite Remus's fears, Teddy did not inherit his father's condition. However it is unknown if it definitively could not be passed on in this manner or if Teddy did not inherit the condition from pure chance, as no other cases are known. In Teddy's case, it was his father who was a werewolf, not his mother, therefore it is unknown if a pregnant female werewolf's transformations would affect the ability to carry the pregnancy to term.\n\nIf two werewolves were to mate at the full moon, in their animal forms, it was possible for them to conceive. This was an extremely rare occurrence only known to have happened twice in recorded history. Any offspring were full wolves that were indistinguishable from mundane wolves except for their near-human intelligence and their beauty. They did not inherit the sadistic behaviours associated with lycanthropy, being no more sadistic than regular wolves.[2]\n\nLord Voldemort referred to werewolf offspring as cubs to his Death Eaters. When at Malfoy Manor, he ridiculed the Malfoys and Bellatrix about the marriage of Remus Lupin and Nymphadora Tonks, asking Draco if he would \"babysit the cubs.\"[9] Given his purist attitude and disdain for 'half-breeds,' this is far more likely to be a derogatory insult rather than an implication that lycanthropy is inheritable. Riddle as a Hogwarts student accused Rubeus Hagrid of raising \"werewolf cubs\" under his bed as a youngster, but since was trying to frame Hagrid, this statement was false and slanderous.[10]\n\nSometime before the 1980s, a pack of lupine werewolf offspring came to live in the Forbidden Forest on the grounds of Hogwarts Castle with the permission of Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of the School.[1] Rumours of a pack of werewolves inhabiting the forest soon spread among the student body. Though they posed little actual threat to students, Hogwarts staff never tried to dispel these rumours because they felt that keeping students out of the forest was highly desirable due to actual dangers present.[2] Due to his rumour, Draco Malfoy claimed in his first year that there were werewolves in the Forbidden Forest. During their shared detention in the Forbidden Forest, Harry Potter asked Rubeus Hagrid if it was possible that a werewolf could be killing the unicorns in the forest (Lord Voldemort was in fact responsible), but Hagrid stated that werewolves were not fast enough.[11]\n\nUnfortunately, there was no cure for lycanthropy. However, some of the worst effects could be mitigated by consuming Wolfsbane Potion, which allowed a werewolf to retain their human mind while transformed, thus freeing them from the worry of harming other humans or themself.[1] It was a very difficult potion to make, with many complicated ingredients. According to Remus Lupin, it tasted disgusting, but sugar rendered it useless.[12]\n\nThe high cost of Wolfsbane ingredients made it virtually impossible for werewolves to brew the potion for themselves, as most were reduced to poverty and could not taste the potion without revealing their statuses. Because werewolves only posed a danger to humans, companionship with animals whilst transformed was known to make the experience more bearable as the werewolf would have no-one to harm and would be less willing to harm themself.[1]\n\nAccording to Gilderoy Lockhart, the Homorphus Charm could permanently force a werewolf back into human shape.[13] However, due to Lockhart's reputation as a liar, and the many falsehoods he told to inflate his popularity,[14] his information is highly suspect — as is the very existence of a Homorphus Charm in the first place. However, as many of Lockhart's claims were also based on the accounts of more trustworthy wizards (accomplishments he would claim for himself, following the disposal of the originating witch or wizard), there is a chance that the charm did, in fact, exist.\n\nIn the 1980s, Cecil Lee, a wizard working for the Ministry of Magic's Werewolf Capture Unit, told Jacob's sibling that he had used the Homorphus Charm during his job. However, for him, the charm \"only\" forced the werewolf to temporarily revert to human form rather than permanently curing them as Lockhart claimed. Though as Lee was a fan of Lockhart's, he believed that this was due to his own inability to perfectly cast the charm.[2]\n\nContrary to what the Muggle world believed, werewolves were not affected by silver, except in that it could be used in the mixture of powdered silver and dittany to prevent a victims' death and would merely close their wounds to prevent bleeding after a severe werewolf attack.[1] There may certainly have been several other ways and solutions to prevent and heal werewolf injuries, as Quirinus Quirrell taught about the topic in first year Defence Against the Dark Arts class.[15] None of them, of course, could completely cure an afflicted person once they were bitten, but could merely prevent and close the physical wounds on the skin.\n\nThe monthly transformation of a werewolf was extremely painful if untreated and was usually preceded and succeeded by a few days of pallor and ill health. The werewolf could display irritation towards people while in the ill following state. While in their wolfish form, the werewolf would entirely lose its human sense of right or wrong. However, it is incorrect to state (as some authorities did, notably Professor Emerett Picardy in his book Lupine Lawlessness: Why Lycanthropes Don’t Deserve to Live) that they suffered from a permanent loss of moral sense.[1]\n\nWhile human, the werewolf could be as good or kind as the next person. Alternatively, they could be dangerous even while human, as in the case of Fenrir Greyback, who attempted to bite and maim as a man and kept his nails sharpened into claw-like points for the purpose. Though werewolves usually only infected their victims through biting, they sometimes took it too far and killed their victims.[1]\n\nWithout any humans nearby to attack, or other animals to occupy it, the werewolf would attack itself out of frustration. This would leave many werewolves such as Remus Lupin with self-inflicted scars and premature ageing from the difficult transformations.[16]\n\nWerewolves were almost indistinguishable in appearance from the true wolf. However, they could be distinguished from regular wolves by their shorter snout, more human-like eyes, the tufted tail, and their mindless hunting of humans and thus more sadistic tendencies whilst in wolf form. At all other times, they appeared as normal humans, although they would age prematurely, and would gain a pallor as the full moon approached and then waned.[1] It was unclear if the premature appearance of ageing is due to the affliction or the physical and mental stress it causes.\n\nIt's possible that some individual physical traits may be present in both forms, as with Chiara Lobosca having silver/white hair in human form and similarly coloured fur in her transformed state.[2]\n\nThe real difference between a wolf and a werewolf was in behaviour. Genuine wolves were not very aggressive, and the vast number of folk tales representing them as mindless predators were believed by wizarding authorities to refer to werewolves, not true wolves. Wolves were unlikely to attack a human except under exceptional circumstances. Werewolves, however, targeted humans almost exclusively and posed very little danger to any other creature.[1]\n\nWerewolves were generally regarded with fear and disgust by wizarding society. People seemed to think even when in human form, the werewolf could pose a danger. It was not uncommon for people known to be werewolves to be shunned by society and discriminated against within the wizarding world. It was very difficult for a werewolf to get a job in the wizarding community, especially after the passing of restrictive anti-werewolf legislation by the very prejudiced and hateful Dolores Umbridge in the 1990s.[17]\n\nUmbridge drafted this legislation due to her irrational and vitriolic hatred for what she considered to be \"half-breeds\".[17] Because of the difficulty in finding work in the wizarding world, many werewolves lived in poverty. It also forced some, like Remus Lupin to take jobs far below their abilities.[18] After Lord Voldemort's defeat in 1998, the anti-werewolf legislation was most likely repealed by the new Minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt, in his effort to reform the Ministry of Magic, therefore weeding out corruption and not tolerating prejudice and discrimination.\n\nAs a result of the anti-werewolf legislation, many werewolves suffered poverty. Remus Lupin managed to get by with the aid of his friend James Potter[19] and later by working as Defence Against the Dark Arts professor at Hogwarts. Though in between he had to work at many jobs that were far below his level of abilities, resigning and moving on to another before his workmates noticed his signs of lycanthropy. Lupin did this while living in a tumbledown, semi-derelict cottage in Yorkshire.[18] He decided to resign from this position after his condition was exposed, by Severus Snape, as most parents would not want their children being around a werewolf,[20] despite the safety precautions Remus and Albus Dumbledore took; Remus stated that it would have been impossible for him to even attend Hogwarts as a child if it were not for Dumbledore's kindness, as other headmasters would not want a werewolf in the school.[16]\n\nIn a display of ignorance and arrogance, the Ministry expected werewolves would submit themselves to the department to sign various conducts and registries, which would also force the werewolves to promise to secure themselves from attacking others. No person would be prepared to walk into the Ministry to admit themselves as werewolves, thus showing the Ministry's lack of respect of werewolves' intelligence and dignity. Lyall Lupin, in particular, regarded werewolves as \"soulless, evil, deserving nothing but death\", until his own son was infected as a result of his prejudicial comment.[18]\n\nGiven Kingsley Shacklebolt's friendship with Remus Lupin and the furthering of Muggle-born and house-elf rights after 1998, it is likely that the reforms of the Ministry under Minister for Magic Shacklebolt included less prejudicial treatment of werewolves.\n\nIn 2010, Renka was an anti-werewolf protestor in Hogsmeade. She thought they were \"mindless beasts\" that had to be driven out of their community. She put posters up around the village warning everyone that they were dangerous and she publicly protested in the streets. When two Hogwarts students disagreed with her, she described them to be naive. Renka thought werewolves were responsible for recent problems plauging the village, even though Abigail pointed out they couldn't do things like envelop the village in a mist. Several villagers agreed with Renka, while others like Rosmerta and Aberforth Dumbledore thought her posters were \"filth\" and she was \"fearmongering\" without a cause.[21]\n\nDue to the oppression and discrimination they faced, some werewolves came to hate the wizarding society, and as such created their own society. Under Fenrir Greyback's leadership, this society worked to infect as many people as possible, especially children, with the goal of one day having enough strength to take control of the wizarding community.[4]\n\nThe werewolves under Greyback's command served Lord Voldemort in the Second Wizarding War, believing that they would have a better life under his rule, though Remus Lupin spied on them for the Order of the Phoenix.[4] Death Eaters looked down on them; for example, they were not permitted to have the Dark Mark.[22] They were used as a threat to ensure ordinary citizens' compliance with Voldemort; for example, five-year-old Montgomery was fatally attacked by Greyback after his mother refused to co-operate with the Death Eaters.[23]\n\nAlthough only Greyback was explicitly known to have participated, werewolves under Greyback's command may have fought alongside the Death Eaters in the Battle of Hogwarts. They were most likely sentenced to Azkaban for life for uniting with Lord Voldemort, or killed for resisting arrest. It is unknown whether this was the only occurrence of the society, though it is implied that it was a new idea of Greyback's. Likewise, it is unknown whether all werewolves in the society were caught, or — as it was \"underground\" — some of the members evaded capture and continued their efforts.\n\nThe Ministry of Magic attempted to regulate werewolves and thus the relationship that existed between them and the Ministry was a rocky one. According to Newton Scamander, werewolves were shunted between the Beast and Being divisions of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures for years.[5]\n\nAt one point, the Werewolf Registry and Werewolf Capture Unit were both in the Beast Division, while at the same time the office for Werewolf Support Services was in the Being Division. These regulations and services were ultimately a failure, as no one would be prepared to walk into the Ministry to admit themselves as werewolves, and thus none took the prescribed responsibilities of the Werewolf Code of Conduct.[1]\n\nThe Werewolf Code of Conduct of 1637 was meant to give Werewolves a framework for co-existing safely and legally within the wizarding world. Werewolves were required to sign a copy of the Code and to promise to refrain from attacking and biting non-werewolves. They were also supposed to lock themselves away during their wolf transformation periods. As no werewolf was willing to sign it, the Ministry had huge difficulty in hunting down culprits of these attacks, such that Fenrir Greyback was able to act innocent in regards to him murdering two Muggle children.[1]\n\nWerewolves were classified as XXXXX creatures in their transformed state.[5] Dolores Umbridge herself incorrectly referred to werewolves as half-breeds, and drafted an anti-werewolf legislation that made it almost impossible for werewolves to find a job.[17]\n\nEven when the Ministry was taken over by the Death Eaters, the relationship between the bureaucracy and werewolves remained strained. Death Eaters and their supremacist allies looked down on werewolves, only using them as foot soldiers and to intimidate the rest of the wizarding world into submission.[24][22] They did let the werewolves have more freedom of movement than before the takeover, but in no way showed they were equals; Greyback was not given the Dark Mark despite being permitted to wear the Death Eater's robe, and genuine Death Eaters looked down on him, while Greyback himself acknowledged that if he took Harry Potter to the Ministry, he would be left out of any credits for capturing him.\n\nIt was not until after the Second Wizarding War, in which Kingsley Shacklebolt took the position of Minster for Magic, did the Ministry's relationship with werewolves improve. Kingsley posthumously awarded his werewolf friend, Remus Lupin, the Order of Merlin, First Class, for his bravery in the war, the first time in history that a werewolf had been accorded this honour. The example of his life and death played an important role in lifting the stigma on werewolves among the wizarding society. The British Ministry of Magic has also setup an outreach programme, allowing the wizarding community to become more inclusive.[25]\n\nWizarding children were educated about werewolves from a young age and information about them could be found in various Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry textbooks, for example The Dark Forces: A Guide to Self-Protection.[26]\n\nWerewolves were mentioned several times in connection with Harry Potter's Defence Against the Dark Arts Professors, as they were Dark creatures which were studied throughout the class.[12] Quirinus Quirrell had encountered them in the Black Forest, and at one point discussed in class how to treat werewolf bites.[15] Gilderoy Lockhart, supposedly, once defeated the Wagga Wagga Werewolf, something that may be discussed in his book Wandering with Werewolves.[13] Lockhart eventually confessed to Ron and Harry that an 'ugly old Armenian warlock' had actually performed the rescue of a village from werewolves that he himself had taken credit for.[14] Remus Lupin, of course, was a werewolf.[27][18]\n\nWerewolves were discussed in one of Harry Potter's third year Defence Against the Dark Arts lessons, with an essay assigned by Severus Snape when he substituted for Lupin, although werewolves were not due to be covered until the last chapter of the third-year DADA textbook.[12]\n\nThere were many books containing information on werewolves, whether it was their main subject or was just mentioned in them:\n\nThe word werewolf is from Old English wer (\"man\") and wulf (\"wolf\").\n\nThe term comes from Ancient Greek λυκάνθρωπος, λύκος being \"wolf\" and άνθρωπος translating to \"human\".",
