  "content": "A troll was a magical beast of prodigious strength and immense stupidity. In fact, they were so synonymous with stupidity that they actually had the lowest wizarding exam failing grade named after them. Trolls were grouped in the taxonomical genus Troglodytarum.[5] Trolls possessed rudimentary magic, but it is not known how they applied it.[6]\n\nTrolls generally reached a height of about twelve feet and weighed up to a tonne.[1] Troll whiskers had magical properties, and were sometimes used as wand cores, though they were considered inferior to the Supreme Cores. Their feet had two toes, both with giant toenails.[7]\n\nThey were dangerously violent and incredibly aggressive, and they engaged in unpredictable behaviour, comparable to giants.[1] They were also incredibly low in intelligence when compared to other species; to give at least one example, giants seemed to have more intelligence than the troll, despite their otherwise similarities.[1] Trolls were particularly attracted to unpleasant smells, such as Dungbombs.[8] They tended to avoid Puffapods, since the entire species was highly allergic to the plant.[9]\n\nTrolls, similar to Acromantulas, had a taste for human flesh. They enjoyed it raw, but were not exactly fussy about what they ate. Trolls were also fond of fish.[3]\n\nTroll language was supposedly nothing more than simple grunts that only trolls seemed to be able to interpret, though skilled magical multi-linguists such as Bartemius Crouch Senior could understand them.[10] Trolls understood only a limited number of human words, and some of the smarter ones who knew English could be skillfully trained as security trolls.[11] Professor Quirrell had a gift for communicating with trolls, having used it to set one loose in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991 in an effort to steal the Philosopher's Stone.[12][13]\n\nMountain trolls had been known to tame and ride Graphorns, or at least try to ride them. However, the Graphorns didn't seem to be very keen on the idea.[1]\n\nTrolls did not usually wear armour and would usually be prone to smashing it in confusion or anger. This makes it all the more surprising that a fully intact suit of Troll Armour was on display in the Armoury during the 1890s.[14]\n\nTrolls originated in Scandinavia, but were later found all across Europe.[1]\n\nTrolls were not recognised as magical beings, but instead classified as beasts by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures of the British Ministry of Magic, most likely due to their aggressive natures.[1] Pierre Bonaccord, the first Supreme Mugwump of the International Confederation of Wizards, wanted to stop troll-hunting and give them rights, but his appointment to that office was contested by Liechtenstein, since they were having problems with a tribe of very dangerous mountain trolls at the time.[15]\n\nArtemius Lawson was an outspoken advocate for the strict restraint of trolls. He thought it was wrong to allow them to roam free, stating that \"they were creatures who weighed a ton, but had brains the size of a bogey\".[16]\n\nThe Black family kept an umbrella stand made out of a troll's leg in their front hall.[17]\n\nIn the end of the 19th century, Ranrok's followers had enlisted trolls among their ranks. In 1890, they sent two of them to attack Hogsmeade in an attempt to create a diversion so that Victor Rookwood could abduct the new fifth-year student that had previously encountered Ranrok. However, the first troll was repelled by officer Ruth Singer and other villagers, while the second one was killed by the student with ancient magic.[18] During the final battle for control of the final repository located beneath Hogwarts, no less than four trolls were mobilised by Ranrok's troops; three of them were disposed of by the student and Professor Eleazar Fig, while the last one was taken out by Professor Aesop Sharp.[19]\n\nThroughout their exploration of the region, the student would frequently encounter trolls (including ones that were not in Ranrok's army), such as when they went to find Bubotuber pus for Sacharissa Tugwood.[20] They also took out the troll that Alexandra Ricketts had unsuccessfully attempted to train to help defend Brocburrow.[21]\n\nAfter the details of the Sorting Ceremony were revealed to him in 1991, Ron stated that he was going to kill his brother Fred, who had scared him earlier by suggesting that the test to get into Hogwarts involved wrestling a troll.[22]\n\nA troll was Quirrell's contribution to guarding the Philosopher's Stone in the Underground Chambers, during the 1991–1992 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.[23]\n\nTo create a diversion so he could go after the Philosopher's Stone, Professor Quirrell let another mountain troll into the castle on Hallowe'en 1991, appearing in the dungeon.[13] It wandered around the corridors until Harry Potter and Ron Weasley locked it in a girls' bathroom, only to realise soon after that Hermione Granger was also in that particular bathroom. With a combination of using the Levitation Charm and what Minerva McGonagall would cite as \"sheer dumb luck\", Ron managed to knock it by levitating its club and dropping it on its head, incapacitating it and saving Hermione.[12]\n\nTrolls participated in wizarding society to some extent; some witches and wizards made a career out of training security trolls.[24] These were evidently a different type of troll than the mountain variety, since they seemed considerably more intelligent and less smelly. Dumbledore hired security trolls to guard the Fat Lady after Sirius Black attacked her. They spent all their time pacing the corridor in front of the Fat Lady's portrait, giving dirty looks to everyone who happened by and comparing the sizes of their clubs.[11] They left at the end of the year, when Sirius was deemed to have left the country.[25]\n\nThe wizarding author and celebrity Gilderoy Lockhart wrote about his supposed adventures with trolls in his book Travels with Trolls, which was a mandatory Defence Against the Dark Arts textbook for his classes in that subject for the 1992–1993 school year when he was that year's Professor.[26] As Lockhart was, in reality, a con artist who took the credit of the achievements of far braver wizards and witches and used the Memory Charm to erase their memories of their deeds, Lockhart in reality had no actual experience with these creatures.[27]\n\nWhen Ron Weasley was captured by Snatchers in 1997, he told them he was Stan Shunpike, due to them not looking very intelligent, and even speculated that one of them might have been part-troll, judging by his odour.[28]\n\nDuring the Calamity, several trolls started randomly appearing throughout the wizarding world guarding various magical Confoundables, with volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force having to incapacitate them with spells such as the the Ebublio Jinx and the Knockback Jinx, in order to overpower the Confoundables and return them to their rightful place.[29]\n\nThere were three known different types of trolls, each with its own highly unique set of physical differences.",
