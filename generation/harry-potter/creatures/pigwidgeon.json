  "content": "Pigwidgeon (fl. 1994 - 1997), also known as Pig or Piggy,[1] was Ron Weasley's first pet owl. He was a miniature scops owl. Pig was responsible for the handling of Ron's mail starting in 1994. He was a gift from Sirius Black after the loss of Ron's pet rat.[2]\n\nAfter Scabbers, Ron's old pet rat, disappeared (having been found out to be Peter Pettigrew), Sirius Black, who felt partly responsible for Ron's loss of a pet, sent him Pigwidgeon (nicknamed \"Pig\"). Upon receiving the owl, Ron (to the surprise of Harry and Hermione) actually let Crookshanks sniff him to check if he really was an owl.[2]\n\nPigwidgeon was named by Ginny Weasley, because she thought the name was cute. Though Ron tried to change it, the owl would not answer to another name. Pigwidgeon was exceedingly hyper, loud, bothersome, very small, and had been known to be a show off for other people (this, however, annoyed other owls, forcing Ron to keep him in his room).[3]\n\nPigwidgeon was described by Harry as resembling a \"fluffy snitch\". He was usually excited for a job to deliver letters, even though most of the time they were usually heavy for him. Harry borrowed Pigwidgeon during the Triwizard Tournament to communicate with Sirius who was in hiding at the time.[4] Fred and George Weasley also asked to borrow him in order to support their secretive business venture.[5]\n\nPigwidgeon was occasionally known to hang around the stairways performing for students. This prompted Ron to call him a \"stupid little feathery git\" for his attempts to show off rather than promptly bringing Ron the letters.[6] He also delivered food to Sirius when he was hiding in a cave in Hogsmeade, though not without the help of Hogwarts owls, as the food was quite heavy.[7]\n\nPigwidgeon travelled with Ron to and from Hogwarts during his years in school, although he stayed at The Burrow when Ron skipped his final year at Hogwarts to accompany Harry and Hermione on the hunt for horcruxes.[8]\n\nDuring the 2020s, Pigwidgeon appeared as a Foundable during the Calamity. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were able to return him to his original time.[9]\n\nPigwidgeon means \"small\" or \"petty\" and also can be spelled pigwidgin or pigwiggin. It combines \"pig\" with \"widgeon\", two species of duck found in North America and Europe, or \"pigeon\", another name for the rock dove. English author and poet Michael Drayton (1563-1631) had a male fairy named Pigwiggen in his comical poem \"Nimphidia\".",
