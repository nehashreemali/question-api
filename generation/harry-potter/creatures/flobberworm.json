  "content": "The Flobberworm was a herbivorous, ten-inch, toothless brown magical worm which ate mainly lettuce and cabbage. It was not considered a particularly interesting creature, with a Ministry of Magic Classification of X, or \"boring\", which was the lowest possible rank.[4][6]\n\nEach end was identical to the other, from which they chewed vegetation and exuded mucus, which was sometimes used to thicken potions.[9] It moved very little and preferred to live in damp ditches.[4] Contrary to the claims of Draco Malfoy and his gang, which were designed to attack Hagrid and his qualities as a professor, Flobberworms did not possess teeth and thus did not bite.[7]\n\nFlobberworms were apparently edible and Flobberworm fritters were sometimes served for lunch at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, much to the dismay of the student body.[10] Flobberworms could also be transfigured into fritters with a spell.[11] The Flobberworm was also notable for being one of the few living creatures capable of being summoned with the Summoning Charm, although it was generally not considered worth summoning.[12]\n\nFlobberworm Mucus was a green and slimy substance commonly used as a thickener in many potions. A popular and useful ingredient, it was used in potions such as the Wiggenweld Potion, Herbicide Potion, and the Sleeping Draught.[8]\n\nDuring the 1986 summer holidays, Rubeus Hagrid bred an excess amount of Flobberworms in his hut, but he was unsure what to do with them.[13]\n\nWhen he taught Care of Magical Creatures, Silvanus Kettleburn normally covered them in third-year classes. However, in the 1986–1987 school year, Severus Snape needed them for Potions, so students who started learning the subject in 1986 did not cover them in the class until their fifth year.[1]\n\nAfter losing his nerve during the Hippogriff debacle in his first Care of Magical Creatures lesson during the 1993–1994 school year, Rubeus Hagrid had his third-year students raise Flobberworms for a term. The exercise was completely pointless, as they preferred to be left alone. They didn't require much care, but they would die if overfed.[6] Later on in the school year, the Flobberworms died from overeating lettuce.[5] During the third year exam in Care of Magical Creatures, Hagrid provided a fresh tub of Flobberworms for the class and had the students keep them alive for one hour to pass the exam.[14]\n\nIn the 1996–1997 school year, Snape's first detention of the year for Harry Potter involved sorting out rotten Flobberworms from fresh ones to be used in Potions (despite Snape no longer teaching the subject), saying that Harry need not bring protective gloves.[15]\n\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, Daniel Page, who needed some Flobberworm Mucus to use to brew a Sleeping Draught, went with a Muggle-born student to ask Rubeus Hagrid for some mucus from his Flobberworms. After Daniel and his friend helped Hagrid collect Dittany to brew Essence of Dittany to help heal the Hippogriff Teartalon and fought off the forest troll that initially attacked her, Hagrid gave them the mucus they needed.[16] In the same school year, Kevin Farrell wanted to learn how to care for a Flobberworm. He was planning to adopt one as a pet. He told the student that they were great pets if the owner doesn't mind their indifference or slime.[17]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the 2010s, several Foundable Flobberworms could be found trapped in large magical green bubble Confoundables. Volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force had to release these Flobberworms from containment using the Severing Charm to return the Flobberworm Foundables to their original place.[18]",
