  "content": "Nagini (d. 2 May 1998) was a Maledictus cursed to transform into a snake. Originating possibly in Indonesia,[2] by 1927 she was a performer at the Circus Arcanus where she met Credence Barebone (Aurelius Dumbledore) and had a romantic relationship with him. By then, she could transform into a snake at will, although her curse did often cause her to transform uncontrollably.\n\nBy 1994, Nagini had permanently transformed into snake form due to her Maledictus curse and came into the possession of Lord Voldemort, who, using the death of Bertha Jorkins, made her into a Horcrux that same year.[7]\n\nAfter Voldemort's initial downfall, he used Nagini's venom as one of the ingredients for a potion to regain strength, which eventually led to his rebirth in 1995. Later in the same year, she attacked Arthur Weasley but he managed to survive.\n\nDuring the Second Wizarding War, she had to be destroyed for Voldemort to finally be defeated. Nagini was killed by Neville Longbottom with Godric Gryffindor's Sword in 1998 and was the last Horcrux to be destroyed after Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem.\n\nNagini was originally a female human Maledictus, with the ability to transform into a snake. She was an Underbeing, which meant she could not do magic and did not have a wand. By 1927, she became a featured attraction in the Circus Arcanus, a wizarding circus owned by Skender, who claimed to have found her in the 'jungles of Indonesia'.\n\nAt some point, she befriended the Obscurial Credence Barebone, who travelled to Europe with the circus after surviving MACUSA's attempt to destroy him in New York after he attacked the city in December 1926. The two became close friends and eventually became romantically involved.\n\nIn September 1927, Nagini and Credence decided to escape from the Circus Arcanus and discover Credence's real identity.[1] Amid her performance and transformation into a snake, Credence released a flock of firedrakes to distract Skender, enabling her to attack Skender and run away with the Obscurial.\n\nAfter that, she and Credence went to 18 Rue Philippe Lorand to find who they hoped would be his biological family. They instead found Irma Dugard, a half-elf, who fondly explained some details of the alleged baby and parents. Unbeknownst to Credence and Nagini, they were followed by one of Gellert Grindelwald's acolytes, Gunnar Grimmson. As the half-elf was about to divulge a key piece of the story, Nagini was suddenly trapped by Grimmson in a wall while he murdered Irma. Grimmson disapparated before Credence's Obscurus could kill him. Nagini tried but failed to escape her locked position inside of the wall until after the event concluded.[8]\n\nLater, on the rooftop of a house near the Eiffel Tower, Nagini and Credence met Grindelwald, who was calling his supporters. He gave them a map of Père Lachaise Cemetery, inviting them to attend his rally there.\n\nIn the Lestrange Mausoleum, they crossed paths with Yusuf Kama and Jacob Kowalski. Yusuf, thinking that Credence was really Corvus Lestrange, tried to kill him. Nagini tried to save the Obscurial, but Kama said that he would kill her too if she did not get out of the way. When Newt Scamander, Tina Goldstein, and Leta Lestrange joined them, Leta proved that Credence and Corvus were two different people, saving both Credence and Nagini from death.\n\nWhen the door to the next chamber opened, Nagini and the others joined Grindelwald's rally. When a fight began, Nagini tried to convince Credence to stay with her. However, he did not listen and decided to join the infamous Dark wizard to learn his true identity. Devastated, Nagini also witnessed Leta's death and was just barely Apparated to safety by Yusuf.[9]\n\nHaving survived the rally, Nagini officially joined forces with Newt Scamander, Theseus Scamander, Tina Goldstein, Jacob Kowalski, and Yusuf Kama and travelled to Hogwarts Castle with them all (as well as Torquil Travers and Rudolph Spielman), where Professor Albus Dumbledore was waiting on the school's viaduct.\n\nAt some point later, Nagini's blood curse permanently turned her into a snake.[10] She was eventually acquired by Lord Voldemort.[5]\n\nVoldemort used Nagini to help him regain strength and a basic physical form after living in a weak, spectral state following his attempt to kill an infant Harry Potter, during which he was struck by his rebounding Killing Curse. He had the servant who returned to him, Peter Pettigrew, milk her venom,[5] and with it, create a potion that sustained him with a temporary body until he could regain his true form.[11] Nagini further kept Voldemort alive after he turned her into a Horcrux with the murder of Bertha Jorkins in 1994. Dumbledore noted that Nagini enhanced Voldemort's mystique and underlined his connection to Salazar Slytherin, which contributed to Dumbledore's suspicion that she had become a Horcrux.[12]\n\nIn the summer of 1994, Nagini, along with Voldemort and Pettigrew, sought shelter in the abandoned Riddle House until they could instigate their plan to capture Harry Potter. Nagini noticed the presence of Frank Bryce, an old Muggle gardener who had worked for the late Riddle family and had overheard a discussion between Pettigrew and Voldemort. Soon after, Nagini slithered past Bryce and alerted Voldemort to his presence, with the Dark Lord murdering the Muggle man. She probably then ate the dead man's corpse.[5]\n\nWhen Pettigrew's neglect allowed Bartemius Crouch Senior to escape Voldemort's Imperius Curse and head towards Hogwarts, Voldemort threatened to feed Pettigrew to Nagini should Crouch successfully report their plans. However, Crouch was intercepted and killed by his own son. Voldemort then mockingly told Nagini she was \"out of luck\" and would not be fed Pettigrew after all, using the moment to further humiliate and intimidate Pettigrew.[13]\n\nUpon Voldemort's rebirth via the capture of Harry, Nagini slithered around the graveyard in which the resurrection ceremony took place[14] and was promised that she could feed on the boy's corpse after her master had killed him.[11] She was deprived of this when Harry escaped via Portkey back to the Hogwarts grounds with Cedric Diggory's corpse (who had been killed by Peter Pettigrew on Voldemort's orders before the ceremony).[15]\n\nShortly before the Christmas of 1995, Nagini was presumably sent by Voldemort to retrieve a Prophecy in the Ministry of Magic. After she had infiltrated the Department of Mysteries, Nagini encountered the Order of the Phoenix member Arthur Weasley, who was sent to guard the very same prophecy. Nagini, unable to resist, and who had attracted Arthur's attention already, attacked him.\n\nThe attack was witnessed by Harry Potter in a dream, during which he saw it through Nagini's eyes.[16] Critically injured, Arthur was taken to St Mungo's. He survived the attack but was required to take a Blood-Replenishing Potion at regular intervals. At the suggestion of Trainee Healer Augustus Pye, Arthur tried stitches, a Muggle replacement, of which his wife, Molly, disapproved.[17]\n\nNagini's venom seemed to delay blood clotting and even dissolved the stitches, which caused the wounds to bleed profusely when the bandages were removed. Ultimately, an antidote to the poison was found and he was cured.[18] Albus Dumbledore believed Harry saw the vision through Nagini's eyes by virtue of the fact that Voldemort's mind \"happened to be\" in Nagini at the time. This was the first indication of Nagini and Voldemort's Horcrux connection, having the ability to share thoughts and connect with Harry.[19]\n\nIn 1997, Nagini was present at a meeting at Malfoy Manor. When the Death Eaters were jeering at Charity Burbage and the Malfoy family's humiliation because of a disgraceful marriage in their family, the great snake got agitated, disliking the noise, and opened her mouth wide and hissed angrily, but to deaf ears. Voldemort allowed the jeering to continue and only called for silence after he'd fulfilled his own purpose.[20]\n\nNear the end of the meeting, Voldemort's prisoner, Hogwarts Muggle Studies teacher, Charity Burbage, was murdered by the Dark Lord by means of the Killing Curse and fed to Nagini.[20]\n\nLater, when Thorfinn Rowle and Antonin Dolohov failed to capture Harry after the Luchino Caffe Duel, Voldemort offered them a choice in punishment: being further tortured by Draco Malfoy or being killed and devoured by Nagini. The two chose further torture, as both survived for the next battle.[21]\n\nNagini was later placed inside the corpse of Bathilda Bagshot by Voldemort's use of extremely Dark Magic and stationed in Godric's Hollow to wait for Harry Potter. When Harry and Hermione Granger arrived there, she lured them into the late witch's home, signalled Voldemort due to the Horcrux connection, and then launched a surprise assault on Harry while the latter was investigating a pile of dirty laundry on a dresser.[4]\n\nBecause some snakes could sense heat and movement in a way humans could not, Nagini was able to detect Harry and Hermione even when they were under the Cloak of Invisibility. Harry fought with Nagini, and the serpent bit him before coiling herself around Harry to hold him in place for Voldemort. However, Hermione came to Harry's assistance, using a Blasting Curse against the snake. The two then jumped out the window and Disapparated just before Voldemort arrived.[4] Later, on Potterwatch, Lee Jordan revealed that the remains of Bathilda's body had been found after being informed by the Order of the Phoenix.[22]\n\nAfter he discovered that Harry was searching for his Horcruxes in 1998, Voldemort placed Nagini into a Protective Magical Cage to prevent her from being killed. He then decided that it was no longer safe to send Nagini on any more missions.\n\nShortly before the one-hour armistice during the Battle of Hogwarts, Voldemort used Nagini to murder Severus Snape in the Shrieking Shack. He did this by expanding the cage over and on top of him. Nagini proceeded to sink her fangs into Snape's neck. Voldemort then pulled the protective cage off of Snape, who fell to the ground with blood gushing from the wound in his neck.[23]\n\nWhen Harry was apparently killed by Voldemort, Nagini was released from the protective enchantment, as he believed there to be no more threats to her life, and she was draped around Voldemort's shoulders during the Death Eaters' victory march back to Hogwarts.[3]\n\nAfter Neville Longbottom had openly defied him, Voldemort punished him by forcing the Sorting Hat onto his head and setting it on fire. The Death Eaters were then attacked, and, during the ensuing battle, Neville pulled out the Sword of Gryffindor from the Hat. He swung the blade in one upward stroke and beheaded Nagini, whose head spun high into the air as her body slumped onto the ground. While this happened, Voldemort screamed in rage, but did not attempt to avenge her.[3]\n\nWith Nagini's death, Voldemort's final Horcrux was destroyed, thereby stripping him of his immortality. He screamed in rage but made no attempt to retaliate against Neville. Voldemort himself finally died when his Killing Curse rebounded onto himself once again.[3]\n\nIn an alternate reality created by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, by saving Cedric Diggory which caused him much humiliation during the Triwizard Tournament, they turned him into a bitter man who would join the Death Eaters. As a result, Cedric killed Neville during the Battle of Hogwarts, thus preventing him from killing Nagini. This allowed Voldemort to retain his immortality, and thus kill Harry, which led to the Dark Lord to effectively conquer the wizarding world.[24]\n\nDuring the Calamity which affected the Wizarding world in the 2010s and early 2020s, Foundable memories of Nagini mysteriously appeared in the world. These Foundables were returned to their proper time by members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[25]\n\nAs a human, she was a beautiful and desirable woman of East Asian descent with long black hair. In her animal form, Nagini was a large, green snake, roughly twelve feet long and as thick as a man's thigh.\n\nPrior to her transformation into a snake, Nagini was a shy, benevolent, quiet, and kind woman, having been abused as a sideshow freak by the Circus Arcanus for so long that it had left the Maledictus insecure and longing to escape to something better. She befriended Credence Barebone, likely seeing a fellow outcast in the young Obscurial and also wanting to no longer be alone in her life, later falling in love with him. Nagini was also principled and moral enough to recognise Gellert Grindelwald for what he was, despite the Dark wizard's persuasive charisma, and adamantly urged Credence not to join him.\n\nUnfortunately, however, Nagini's pleas availed her not, and she was left heartbroken when Credence decided to fall back in with Grindelwald, being too desperate to know his true name and identity. After losing Credence, Nagini seemingly wished to help defeat Grindelwald and end the Global Wizarding War, since she joined forces with Newt Scamander, Theseus Scamander, Tina Goldstein, Jacob Kowalski, Yusuf Kama, Torquil Travers, and Rudolph Spielman, subsequently going to Hogwarts Castle with them all to meet with Albus Dumbledore.\n\nBy the time she had become a Horcrux and, it seemed, permanently stuck in her Maledictus serpent form, Nagini's original kind and gentle personality had been entirely expunged — she was now completely loyal to Lord Voldemort. Her curse caused her to gradually and irreversibly transform into a snake. Unlike an Animagus, who can transform at will and retains their human mind in animal form, a Maledictus completely loses their human sentience.[26]\n\nWhen Nagini posed as Bathilda Bagshot to ambush Harry Potter, this was achieved through Voldemort possessing her or directly controlling her actions, as he had done previously when attacking Arthur Weasley at the Department of Mysteries. Any apparent strategic thinking or understanding of human behaviour during this encounter stemmed from Voldemort's intelligence and planning rather than Nagini's own capabilities. As a Maledictus who had fully transformed and lost her human mind by this point, Nagini functioned as an animal acting on instinct and her owner's direction.\n\nTragically, Nagini's transformation resulted in her serving the very ideology that would have targeted her human self. As a Maledictus, Nagini was classified as an \"underbeing\", an individual without magical powers but of magical ancestry. She stated that purebloods \"kill the likes of us for sport.\" Voldemort, who championed pureblood supremacy and revered magical power above all else, would have despised her powerless human form. Yet her permanent transformation into a snake made her useful to him as a weapon and Horcrux vessel. In her snake form, she became a tool of oppression against the very people, the marginalised, the powerless, the \"lesser\", that her human self belonged to. Her loss of humanity didn't just rob her of her identity but forced her to serve an ideology that viewed people like her as targets.\n\nAs a member of Skender's Circus Arcanus, Nagini had been abused by him as a sideshow freak, with this mistreatment lasting so long that it left the young woman insecure and longing to escape to something better. Hence, as soon as the opportunity to escape from Skender presented itself, she readily took it — going into snake form to bite Skender in the shoulder and fleeing with Credence's help.\n\nWhen Skender was later questioned by Auror Tina Goldstein about Nagini and Credence, he sneered at how all of his \"freaks\" desired to \"go home\" and didn't seen interested in pursuing them. Due to her prolonged abuse by Skender, Nagini was able to see through Gellert Grindelwald's charming words and wasn't at all tempted to join the Dark wizard's forces.\n\nWhile at the Circus Arcanus, Nagini met and befriended fellow outcast Credence Barebone, with the two of them being drawn close together due to their similarly tragic pasts. Wishing to stay together, they hatched a plan of escape. Nagini assisted Credence's quest to find out his true identity and proceeded to hug and comfort the young Obscurial following the death of Irma Dugard.\n\nWhen Credence was being tempted by Grindelwald, Nagini desperately implored her friend to stay with her, but was ultimately unable to stop Credence from joining the Dark wizard. However, Nagini's devastation over losing Credence induced her to officially join the Global Wizarding War against Grindelwald.\n\nNagini seemed fearful of the infamous Dark wizard upon suddenly meeting him on a rooftop, as she didn't say a word while Grindelwald invited Credence to his rally at the Lestrange Mausoleum. During the rally, despite Grindelwald's extremely persuasive rhetoric, Nagini's own past experiences at the Circus Arcanus made her able to see Grindelwald for what he truly was, so she resisted joining his followers and desperately pleaded with Credence to resist as well, though she was tragically unsuccessful.\n\nNagini was nearly killed by Grindelwald's subsequent lethal blue fire, only being saved in time by Yusuf Kama. As such, Nagini greatly desired the downfall of Grindelwald and officially joined the Global Wizarding War effort against him, with her even visiting Grindelwald's former friend Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts shortly thereafter, together with Newt Scamander.\n\nVoldemort had a unique relationship with Nagini, as she was his pet and one of his Horcruxes. According to Albus Dumbledore, Voldemort came 'perhaps as fond of her as he can be of anything'.[12] However, Dumbledore's assessment may have been speculative, as he acknowledged elsewhere that he could misjudge Voldemort's attachments. [27]\n\nVoldemort's interactions with Nagini were predominantly utilitarian. Throughout their association, Voldemort interacted with Nagini only when he needed to use her for some purpose. She functioned as an attack dog and a vessel for his soul fragment. Every documented interaction between them involved him exploiting her in some capacity, whether as a weapon, a tool for intimidation, or a means of sustaining his own existence. When his Horcruxes came under threat, he finally kept her close and stated 'he would not be parted from her anymore', suggesting he had not been keeping her close previously. In his private thoughts, Voldemort usually regarded Nagini with impersonal pronouns, yet deliberately used feminine pronouns when speaking of her to others. The calculated choice served to enhance his mystique and instill fear in his followers.[28]\n\nSeverus Snape was surprised when Dumbledore informed him that Voldemort would eventually become concerned for Nagini's safety, indicating that Voldemort had shown no prior evidence of such concern despite their years of association. This lack of observable attachment aligned with Voldemort's pattern of regularly sending Nagini on dangerous missions without apparent regard for her wellbeing until his Horcruxes were threatened.[29]\n\nHe was able to communicate with Nagini as a Parselmouth and he turned her into a Horcrux in 1994 after he murdered Bertha Jorkins, which accounted for the unusual amount of control that he had over her. By 1997, and likely before then, he was able to communicate with her silently and across great distances, as she was able to signal to him when Harry Potter arrived at Godric's Hollow. This may have been due to her nature as a Horcrux, which gave her a link to Voldemort like the one Harry possessed.[4]\n\nVoldemort was also able to possess Nagini, which he did in December 1995 during the attack on Arthur Weasley. In 1994, Peter Pettigrew milked Nagini's venom to return Voldemort to a rudimentary body and, as a Horcrux, her very existence contributed to maintaining Voldemort's immortality. While Voldemort was known for his independence, he recognised Nagini's utility as both a weapon and a link to his Slytherin heritage. However, the primary reason he made her into a Horcrux was circumstantial. According to Dumbledore, Voldemort likely created this Horcrux after murdering Bertha Jorkins while living as a disembodied soul fragment in Albania. The murder provided the opportunity, and Nagini's presence made her a convenient vessel.\n\nHe fed Nagini the corpses of his victims, such as Charity Burbage, which served the dual purpose of sustaining his snake and disposing of bodies.\n\nVoldemort stopped sending Nagini on missions after he realised that Harry knew about the existence of his Horcruxes and was tracking them down, placing her within a barrier to keep his soul fragment safe, so long as he believed she was under the threat of being killed by Harry. Voldemort was enraged when Nagini was beheaded by Neville Longbottom with Godric Gryffindor's Sword, though he never attempted to kill him in retaliation. Nagini was the last Horcrux to be destroyed.[3]\n\nNagini was aloof and indifferent to the Death Eaters as a whole, but sometimes could be irritated by them, as she hissed angrily at their loud laughter at Malfoy Manor, though Voldemort ignored Nagini's displeasure, allowing the laughter to continue and only called for silence when Bellatrix was on the verge of tears. [20] Peter Pettigrew milked venom from her fangs for use in Voldemort's potion.[5] Pettigrew, Antonin Dolohov, and Thorfinn Rowle were threatened to become Nagini's meal in lieu of torture.[13][21]\n\nUnder Voldemort's order, Nagini ruthlessly bit Severus Snape in a fatal location, dealing him a slow, painful demise.[23] Because of this, many of the Death Eaters were terrified of Nagini, though none knew she was a Horcrux until Snape learnt this from Dumbledore.[29]\n\nNagini was frequently used by Voldemort to kill others or to dispose of their dead bodies. In 1995, he told Nagini that she could devour Harry Potter after he had killed him.[13][11] However, she was denied this when Harry escaped from the graveyard shortly after the promise was made.[15] It was likely that Bertha Jorkins and Frank Bryce met that intended fate in the summer of 1994. Voldemort threatened Peter Pettigrew with being fed to Nagini if Bartemius Crouch Snr was able to contact Albus Dumbledore about the plot behind the Triwizard Tournament. Nagini also attacked Arthur Weasley, but he survived the bites after Harry had a vision of the attack and he was quickly aided.[16]\n\nDuring the meeting at Malfoy Manor, she consumed the body of Charity Burbage after Voldemort killed her.[20] Later, when Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle did not capture Harry Potter and his friends after the skirmish at Luchino Caffe, Voldemort offered them a choice in the form of punishment: being tortured by Draco Malfoy's Cruciatus Curse or being killed and eaten by Nagini.[21] After the skirmish at Malfoy Manor, furious Voldemort discovered Pettigrew's dead body and possibly ordered Nagini to consume his dead corpse after he was strangled to death by his own enchanted hand. During the Battle of Hogwarts, she attacked and killed Severus Snape in the Shrieking Shack.[23]\n\nIn Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Nagini was not protected by the magical orb, but instead by what appeared to be an invisible force field that deflected all spells cast at her. This allowed her to participate in the second stage of the battle, as opposed to dying before it began, where she attempted to strike Harry from the back while Voldemort duelled him from the front. Ultimately, she was fighting against Hermione and Ron, both of whom tried to stab her with a Basilisk fang, before Neville decapitated her. Upon her death, she vanished into black smoke, as opposed to simply dying and falling onto the ground in the novel. Why her body perished was not known, and she was the only Horcrux to disappear in such manner; all the others did not disappear, but instead left behind fragmented pieces, except the Diadem when Ron kicked the remnants into the oncoming Fiendfyre. Also, Nagini was killed while Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort were duelling, when in the book, Neville Longbottom killed Nagini while Voldemort and his Death Eaters were in the Entrance Hall. Furthermore, Voldemort's and Snape's final meeting occurs in the Boathouse in the film, as opposed to the Shrieking Shack in the novel, and thus Nagini murders Snape there instead of on her master's orders.",
