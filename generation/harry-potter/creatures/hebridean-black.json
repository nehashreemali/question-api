  "content": "The Hebridean Black was a dragon species native to the Hebrides islands of Scotland. It had brilliant purple coloured eyes.[1]\n\nIt had dark rough scales, ridges along its back, and a tail tipped with an arrow-shaped spike. The Hebridean Black had brilliant purple eyes, bat-like wings and could grow to be up to thirty feet long.\n\nIts favourite food was deer, although it had been known to carry off dogs, sheep, and cattle.[1] It would also hunt other magical beasts such as Graphorns if it was starving or if its preferred prey were unavailable.\n\nDespite its generally aggressive nature, it would sometimes spare wizards and witches who showed it some form of compassion, such as liberating it from captivity and returning its stolen egg.[3][4]\n\nThe Hebridean Black was more aggressive than the other dragon species native to the British Isles, the Common Welsh Green, and thus required a territory of as much as one hundred square miles each. The MacFusty clan took responsibility for the dragons, and had so done for centuries.[1]\n\nA Hebridean Black under the control of Ranrok was involved in an attack on Eleazar Fig and George Osric during their flight to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry on 1 September 1890.[5] Later that year, another Hebridean Black was captured by the poachers and captivated at Horntail Hall, before being freed by student Poppy Sweeting and her friend.[3] Later, the two students decided to seek her and give her back her egg, which had also been stolen by her captors. Having apparently recognised them after cornering them at the edge of a cliff and seeing them put the egg back in its nest, the dragon decided to spare them and left with her offspring, presumably towards a safer place.[4]\n\nAnother Hebridean Black could sometimes be seen flying around Scotland, carrying away livestock. Strangely, it would never attempt to attack anyone but its prey, even if said person was in its way.[6]\n\nDinah Hecat had the skeleton of a Hebridean Black in her Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom. At the start of a lesson in the 1890–1891 school year, she had to use the Levitation Charm to stop it breaking in a fall when her students were duelling. It was a token from the Great Poacher Raid of 1878.[7] Through unknown means, Archie Bickle had acquired a Hebridean Black scale by the 1890-1891 school year. It was one of his prized possessions, and he kept it in his hideout along with other assorted items.[8]\n\nThey were also the team mascot for the Banchory Bangers Quidditch team from Scotland.[2][9]",
