  "content": "The Niffler was a magical beast with a long snout and a coat of black, fluffy fur.[1] They were attracted to shiny things, which made them wonderful for locating treasure, but that also meant that they could wreak havoc if kept (or let loose) indoors.[1] Nifflers in general were usually harmless.[1]\n\nStudents at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry learnt about Nifflers in Care of Magical Creatures class,[4][5] an elective that could be chosen in the third year of their education.\n\nNifflers were assigned to Curse-Breakers by the Gringotts Head Goblin to burrow underground in search of treasures hidden in cursed sites.[1]\n\nThe Rare, Obscure, and Confounding Case Division utilised Nifflers that had skills far beyond that of a normal Niffler, such as sniffing all sorts of things out, surveillance and reconnaissance, and perhaps even some defence.[6]\n\nNifflers were rodent-like creatures with a long snout similar to that of a platypus and a coat of black, fluffy fur.[1] Native to Britain, they lived in burrows as deep as twenty feet below ground, and females produced six to eight young in a single litter.[1]\n\nNifflers had a pouch on their bellies which held far more than at first seemed possible, like the effects of an Undetectable Extension Charm on a container.[7]\n\nNifflers were gentle by nature and could even be affectionate towards their owners.[1] However, they could destroy belongings looking for sparkly objects, and for that reason it was inadvisable to keep them as a house pet.[1] It was also implied that they could turn vicious if provoked, as the second Niffler released into Dolores Umbridge's office apparently tried to take a chunk out of her leg.[8]\n\nNifflers were kept by goblins to burrow for treasure.[1]\n\nNewt Scamander owned a Niffler named Teddy, who escaped twice from his suitcase during his visit to New York in 1926 and tried to rob both the Steen National Bank and a jewel shop of numerous valuables.[9] In 1927, the same Niffler produced four offspring, each in a different colour.[10] This same Niffler snuck out of Newt's case at Gellert Grindelwald's rally and took the blood pact.[11]\n\nPatricia Rakepick kept a Niffler named Sickleworth that she used on her Curse-Breaking assignments for Gringotts. Her Niffler was known to be very well behaved.[5] Jacob's sibling borrowed it to help with finding the Forest Vault in the Forbidden Forest.[12]\n\nSilvanus Kettleburn was known to keep twelve Nifflers, even when they had wrecked his house, boat and his favourite prosthetic leg.[5] Kettleburn taught his fourth-year students during the 1987–1988 school year at Hogwarts about how to handle Nifflers, with Patricia Rakepick lending her pet Niffler, Sickleworth, for one lesson.[5]\n\nJacob's sibling kept a Niffler in the Magical Creatures Reserve,[13] and trained it with the help of Rubeus Hagrid.[14]\n\nMerula Snyde used the Engorgement Charm to enlarge a Niffler to gigantic size, increasing its potential damage, during an incident where a large number of magical creatures escaped containment, in an attempt to get Hagrid, Jacob's sibling and their friends in trouble. Jacob's sibling defeated Merula in a duel, disabling her long enough to return the creature back to its original size.[15]\n\nDuring the 1994–1995 school year, Rubeus Hagrid used Nifflers as part of the fourth year's Care of Magical Creatures class. Prior to the class, he hid Leprechaun gold in the earth in front of his hut. He paired each student with a Niffler and promised a prize to whoever found the most gold. Before the lesson started, a Niffler leapt up onto Pansy Parkinson and tried to bite her watch off her wrist, to which she shrieked and jumped back. Ron Weasley asked Rubeus Hagrid if they could buy these Nifflers as pets, to which Hagrid said his mum wouldn't want one because they wrecked houses, but this was not a definitive \"no\". This means there was a chance that wizards could purchase Nifflers. When Hagrid caught Gregory Goyle pocketing the gold, he explained that trying to steal it was pointless, as Leprechaun gold was worthless because it disappeared after a few hours. Ron's Niffler found the most gold, so Hagrid rewarded him with an extremely large slab of chocolate from Honeydukes.[4]\n\nDuring Dolores Umbridge's tenure as Headmistress of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Lee Jordan used the Levitation Charm to levitate Nifflers through her office window to wreck the office.[8] One tore her office apart searching for shiny objects and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers,[3] with a later one trying to take a chunk out of her leg.[8] Umbridge blamed Hagrid for it, which did not help him in the least during her Hogwarts High Inquisitor inspections.[3]\n\nNifflers were among the threats to the Statute of Secrecy that the International Confederation of Wizards had to deal with during the Calamity in the 2010s, as they manifested as Foundables.[16]",
