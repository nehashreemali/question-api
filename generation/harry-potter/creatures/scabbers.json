  "content": "Peter Pettigrew, O.M. (First Class),[11] (c. 1960 – March 1998), usually referred to as Wormtail or, in his Animagus form, Scabbers[12] was a wizard who began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1971 and was sorted into Gryffindor House after the Sorting Hat pondered over which house he belonged in for over five minutes, making him a true Hatstall. During his years at Hogwarts, he became one of the Marauders; he was best friends with Sirius Black, James Potter, and Remus Lupin, and together they created the Marauder's Map.\n\nDuring the First Wizarding War, Peter was a member of the Order of the Phoenix, but became a spy when he was coerced into joining Lord Voldemort. He was made Secret-Keeper for the Potters when they went into hiding with the use of the Fidelius Charm, and betrayed James, his wife Lily, and their son Harry to Lord Voldemort. After Voldemort's fall, he faked his own death and framed Sirius for betraying James and Lily, as well as for his own murder and those of the twelve Muggles he killed during his escape.[5]\n\nPeter spent twelve years living in his Animagus form as the Weasley family's pet rat, Scabbers.[12] However, his identity was exposed by Sirius and Remus in 1994, and Pettigrew, with nowhere else to go, sought protection in returning to the service of Lord Voldemort, whom he found in the forests of Albania.\n\nPettigrew played a key role in Voldemort's rebirth and continued to serve him during the Second Wizarding War. In the spring of 1998, during a skirmish at Malfoy Manor, in a moment of rare mercy, he hesitated to strangle Harry. The silver hand Lord Voldemort had given Pettigrew interpreted his hesitation as weakness and/or disloyalty, and strangled him to death, saving Harry and finally finding redemption for his treason, but many remained dubious of the evidence of his innate bravery.[13]\n\nPeter Pettigrew was born around 1959/1960. His mother was a witch, and his father's blood status was unknown.\n\nPettigrew began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 1971–1972 school year. During his Sorting Ceremony, the Sorting Hat wavered between placing him in Slytherin or Gryffindor. After a deliberation of more than five minutes (making Pettigrew a Hatstall), the Hat decided to sort him into Gryffindor.[13]\n\nHe soon became friends with Sirius Black, James Potter, and Remus Lupin, fellow Gryffindors he idolised for their popularity and talents. Pettigrew took part in James's and Sirius's bullying of Severus Snape, a Slytherin boy in the same year as the Marauders.[6]\n\nHe, James, and Sirius soon discovered Remus Lupin to be a werewolf, but they did not abandon him as many other wizards would have. Instead, they spent years learning how to become Animagi so that they could accompany Remus during his transformations. Pettigrew's Animagus form was a rat, from which his nickname \"Wormtail\" was derived.\n\nThe four friends called themselves the Marauders and designed the Marauder's Map to navigate Hogwarts.[12] Pettigrew's rat form helped him slip through the Whomping Willow's branches and immobilise the tree in order to let himself and the Marauders enter the Shrieking Shack. Professor Minerva McGonagall described Pettigrew as a \"stupid and foolish boy\" who hero-worshipped Sirius and James. She also stated that Pettigrew was a less than average student and was not capable of fighting with Sirius. She was somewhat harsh with him during their years of student-teacher relationship.\n\nAfter graduating from Hogwarts in 1978, Pettigrew and his friends joined the Order of the Phoenix and fought against Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters during the First Wizarding War. However, by October 1980, Pettigrew began working as a spy for Voldemort, having come to believe that nothing could be gained from opposing him.[14]\n\nDespite being considered a low-ranking soldier for his cowardice and general lack of usefulness, Pettigrew was given the Dark Mark and accepted into the ranks of the Death Eaters, most likely because of his ability to provide important information from within the Order of the Phoenix itself. During his time as a Death Eater, nobody, not even Albus Dumbledore, seemed to suspect him of working for Voldemort. Pettigrew was more than likely responsible for the Order's extremely heavy losses in the later years of the war via leaking the names of Order members to the Death Eaters, causing them to subsequently be hunted down and murdered, sometimes alongside their family members and even occasionally at Voldemort's own hand. The Order eventually suspected there was an informer amongst them due to repeated setbacks, but Pettigrew remained in their trust.\n\nAfter a prophecy was made regarding Harry Potter and the Dark Lord, James and Lily Potter took their son and went into hiding. During their time in hiding, as detailed in Lily's letter to Sirius after Harry's first birthday, Pettigrew visited them at least once. In an attempt at misdirection, they were convinced to select Pettigrew as their Secret-Keeper by Sirius Black, who believed that no one would suspect that Pettigrew was the Keeper. On Hallowe'en night 1981, Pettigrew betrayed his friends, and Voldemort murdered James and Lily but was unable to do the same to their son when his Killing Curse rebounded, destroying his physical form.[12] Upon arriving at the wreckage of the Potters' house, Pettigrew deduced what had happened, took Voldemort's wand,[15] which was left among the rubble, fearing the Ministry would discover his treason through inspecting it, and hid it in an undisclosed location.\n\nApart from James and Lily, Sirius Black was the only person who knew that Pettigrew had been their Secret-Keeper. When he realised what Pettigrew had done, as his hiding place was empty with no signs of a struggle, he tracked him down hoping to avenge his friends. When he closed in on him, Pettigrew screamed that Sirius had betrayed the Potters for everyone to hear, and before Black could draw his wand, Pettigrew swiftly pulled out his own from his back and then killed twelve Muggles by blowing up the street with an extremely powerful curse (likely the Blasting Curse), which created a crater large enough that the sewer pipes were showing. He then faked his own death by cutting off a finger and leaving it behind as he transformed into a rat and fled.[5]\n\nSirius was arrested for being a Death Eater, killing Pettigrew and the Muggles, and betraying the Potters, and was imprisoned in Azkaban without a trial. The surviving Muggles who witnessed the event had their memories erased and were given an excuse by the Muggle-Worthy Excuse Committee that a gas leak occurred. Pettigrew was unjustly awarded the Order of Merlin, First Class for his confrontation with Sirius, which, along with the finger that they recovered, were \"posthumously\" given to his mother.[12] Even the other remaining Marauder, Remus, believed that Sirius betrayed them and killed Pettigrew. As the time passed, due to misconceptions, many believed that Black drew his wand and killed Pettigrew before the other had a chance of even drawing.\n\nAt some point before or during the early 1980s, Pettigrew joined the mysterious organisation R. He entered the fourth Cursed Vault, the Buried Vault, with Jacob and Patricia Rakepick. When unable to defeat the Hungarian Horntail that guarded it, he escaped in fear, leaving Jacob and Rakepick behind. He went into hiding after this event.[16]\n\nPettigrew went into hiding as a rat, hoping to avoid Lord Voldemort's other supporters. As Voldemort had met his downfall on Peter's information, the Death Eaters suspected him of being a traitor; he feared that if they learned of his continued existence, the ones who escaped incarceration (such as Lucius Malfoy and Corban Yaxley) would kill him for leaving their organisation in such a chaotic state. Looking for a wizarding family to take him in, he came into the possession of Percy Weasley and, later, Percy's youngest brother Ron. He was taken good care of while living with the Weasleys and was named \"Scabbers\".\n\nDuring the 1985–1986 school year, Peter, disguised as Scabbers, was kidnapped by Todd and Corrine Cribb, but was eventually saved by Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde along with the other pets and brought back to the castle.[17]\n\nAs Scabbers, Pettigrew returned to Hogwarts with Percy Weasley when he began his education in the 1987–1988 school year. Jacob's sibling met him and Percy immediately after the Start-of-Term Feast the following year while helping William Weasley study for his Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests. During this time, Percy seemed to be the only one to think positively of the rat.[18]\n\nLater in the 1988–1989 school year, he escaped from Percy and briefly regained possession of the Marauder's Map. He was found in his rat form along with the map in the Cursed Corridor by Jacob's sibling.[19] He escaped again, but later encountered Jacob's sibling while in his human form. He obliviated the student to make them forget about their encounter, and escaped yet again.[20] He eventually ended up back with Percy, and his disappearance during the year did not make the Weasleys suspect anything about him.\n\nLater in that same school year, Pettigrew, as Scabbers, took part in a race between a group of Hogwarts students' pets on the Hogwarts Quidditch pitch after Jacob's sibling invited Percy to participate. During the race, however, he refused to move from the starting line, thus losing the race.[21]\n\nIt was clear Scabbers was an extraordinary rat. He was unusually old for a rat, as, although rats had an average life expectancy of two to three years, the Weasley family owned him for twelve. The reason he chose to be adopted by a wizard family was that he could keep track of the news in the wizarding world and could rejoin his master should he return to power. Positioned as he was, he could also bring Harry Potter as a welcome-back gift, so no Death Eater would dare claim him a traitor, but he never took action during his time as Ron's pet, because Voldemort was not strong enough to protect him.\n\nDespite once biting Gregory Goyle on the knuckle when he attempted to steal Harry and Ron's food, Ron generally thought that Scabbers was useless, since all Scabbers did was 'eat and sleep'. However, Ron did show his affections for Scabbers as he became quite upset when he thought Scabbers had been eaten by Hermione Granger's cat Crookshanks.[12]\n\nIn 1993, Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban after seeing a picture of Pettigrew's rat form in a Daily Prophet article about the Weasley family's trip to Egypt.[12] Soon, Scabbers began to thin and bald. Ron thought at first that this was due to the stress of the trip and then due to fear of Hermione Granger's cat Crookshanks, while Harry thought that Scabbers was finally reaching the end of his lifespan. In reality, he had been agitated by the news of Sirius Black's escape from Azkaban, afraid that he would find him and finally avenge the Potters.\n\nEventually, Pettigrew faked his death yet again, by biting himself and leaving blood, allowing Ron to believe that Crookshanks had eaten the rat. This incident almost ruined Ron's and Hermione's friendship until they reconciled over helping Rubeus Hagrid appeal his defence of Buckbeak the Hippogriff. Hermione later discovered Pettigrew hiding in a milk jug in Hagrid's cabin.\n\nThat same year, Remus Lupin, who had been unaware of Pettigrew's duplicity and believed him to be dead, began teaching Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. He began to suspect the truth when he saw Peter's name appear on the Marauder's Map, a charmed parchment created by him and his friends that came into Harry's possession through Fred and George Weasley. On 6 June 1994, Scabbers was found hiding in Hagrid's hut. When Ron attempted to bring him back to the castle, Scabbers tried to escape but was caught by Ron in the shadow of the Whomping Willow.\n\nThere, Ron and Pettigrew were dragged to the Shrieking Shack by Sirius, followed immediately by Ron's friends Harry Potter and Hermione Granger. After heated discussion and the arrival of Professors Lupin and Severus Snape, Pettigrew was unmasked by Sirius and Remus. He initially attempted to redirect the blame to Sirius, but when the truth came out and all the evidence was against him, he appealed for mercy to each person in the Shack (other than Snape, who had been unconscious since before Pettigrew's exposure). Each of them was disgusted by his cowardice, and his daring to ask them for mercy after deceiving them in so many ways infuriated them even more.\n\nRemus and Sirius planned to kill their former friend, but Harry intervened after Pettigrew claimed that Harry's father would have never killed him. This, along with Harry's own belief that his father would not want his best friends to become killers, led him to be merciful. Although Harry had intended to hand Pettigrew over to the Aurors and use him to clear Sirius's name, at last, this created a life debt between Harry and Pettigrew.\n\nThe plan was upset, though, when the full moon rose, and, as Remus had forgotten to take his Wolfsbane Potion after discovering Pettigrew's name on the Marauder's Map, he transformed into an uncontrollable werewolf. Sirius was forced to take on his Animagus form, that of a dog, to protect Harry, Ron, and Hermione, and Peter took advantage of the chaos, cursing Ron with Remus's wand, transforming into his rat form, and fleeing.\n\nAfter his escape from capture at Hogwarts, Pettigrew had no choice but to rejoin his master lest Sirius and Remus kill him. He went to retrieve Voldemort's wand and then travelled to Albania, where he learned from the rats there of a place in the forest where the creatures feared to travel. They said a dark shadow (Voldemort) took over the animals and killed them.[22]\n\nOn his way to his master, Peter ran into Bertha Jorkins, a Ministry witch who was on holiday in Albania, while he had stopped at an inn for food. Although she recognised him, Pettigrew was able to lure her into the forest and overpower her, before handing her over to the Dark Lord. Under torture, Jorkins gave them information that helped Voldemort make plans for an attack on Harry Potter, including information on the Triwizard Tournament, the location of a faithful Death Eater, and that she was later hit by a Memory Charm — meant to hide the existence of said Death Eater — so hard that she suffered permanent brain damage. Voldemort killed the irreparable Bertha, which Peter thought was a mistake, believing that they should have modified her memory and that her disappearance would not go unnoticed.[22]\n\nPettigrew milked venom from Voldemort's snake, Nagini, to strengthen him and provide him with a rudimentary body.[22] He carried Voldemort's weak, small body on the long journey back to Britain, where they took up temporary residence in the Riddle House outside of Little Hangleton. Voldemort called Peter by his Marauder name, \"Wormtail.\"[22]\n\nOver time, Pettigrew tried unsuccessfully to convince Voldemort to use a wizard other than Harry Potter to rebuild his body. Pettigrew offered to capture one if Voldemort would permit him to leave his side for a few days, but Voldemort saw this as an attempt at desertion and claimed that Pettigrew was regretting ever returning to him in the first place. Voldemort noted how Pettigrew always flinched when he set eyes upon him and shuddered when touching him, which further enforced his belief that Pettigrew would have escaped if given the opportunity. Knowing that, if Pettigrew was not there to milk Nagini's venom and feed him, he would lose his strength further enforced his inability to let his servant leave. When Voldemort ordered Wormtail to turn his chair around so he could face Frank Bryce, Wormtail whimpered before doing so.\n\nPettigrew took Voldemort to the Crouch family's house to free Barty Crouch Jnr, the faithful Death Eater Jorkins had mentioned, and in turn subjugate Barty Crouch Snr. For his next assignment, Pettigrew was sent with Barty Jnr to capture the former Auror Alastor Moody, who was set to teach Defence Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. While Crouch became Moody's double and set off in his place to Hogwarts, Pettigrew was assigned to watch over the Imperiused Barty Snr. Pettigrew neglected his duty, with the result that Crouch escaped and nearly sabotaged the plan. However, he was intercepted by Crouch Jnr, and Pettigrew was punished using the Cruciatus Curse.[22]\n\nPettigrew played an important role in the rebirth of Lord Voldemort. Harry and Cedric Diggory were both transported to the graveyard of Little Hangleton. Voldemort ordered Pettigrew to \"kill the spare\", and Cedric was struck with the Killing Curse. To his horror, Harry saw a flash of green light, then heard the sound of a body hitting the graveyard's ground. He was then restrained to Tom Riddle Snr's grave marker so that Pettigrew could cut his arm open and take some of his blood to use in a Dark potion to restore Voldemort to full power and strength. While taking Harry's blood, Pettigrew refused to make eye contact, possibly feeling some reluctance regarding his actions.[23]\n\nPettigrew also took a bone from the grave of Tom Riddle Snr and his own hand as part of the potion. Voldemort regained a corporeal body and therefore was returned to full power.[24] He ordered Pettigrew to stretch out his uninjured left arm, bearing the Dark Mark.[25] Voldemort touched it, and Death Eaters who were loyal or evaded capture came to him at once.\n\nAs a reward for his assistance, Voldemort replaced Pettigrew's severed hand with a silver one, albeit with a warning attached about never letting his loyalty waver again. Pettigrew then witnessed the duel that broke out between Voldemort and Harry.[22]\n\nBy mid-1996, Pettigrew was sent to Severus Snape's house on Spinner's End to \"assist\" his childhood nemesis. However, Snape treated Pettigrew as a mere servant, committing him to menial tasks such as housecleaning and guest reception. Pettigrew, while very dissatisfied with how lowly he was being treated, made very feeble protests that heavily implied he was too afraid to request reassignment.\n\nPettigrew was at the house when Narcissa Malfoy made an Unbreakable Vow with Snape, with Bellatrix Lestrange serving as Bonder. He did not, however, hear its contents, as he had been ordered out of the room by Snape after he was caught eavesdropping at the door, something that he had often been doing, according to Snape.[26]\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Pettigrew was staying at Malfoy Manor, the headquarters of the Death Eaters, and acted as gaoler for those imprisoned in the cellar there.[27] During the Meeting at Malfoy Manor, he was ordered by Voldemort to check on their prisoner, Garrick Ollivander, the wandmaker, in the cellar and keep him quiet. Ollivander had also been forced to make a new wand for Pettigrew.[8] He also kept an eye on Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts at the time. He, along with all the other Death Eaters present, watched as Voldemort murdered her with the Killing Curse and fed her body to Nagini.[28]\n\nAround Easter of 1998, at the height of the Second Wizarding War, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Dean Thomas, and Griphook were brought to the Manor by a group of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback. Bellatrix Lestrange isolated Hermione for interrogation and torture as to how the trio obtained Godric Gryffindor's sword, which she thought was secure in her Gringotts vault. When they heard a noise from the cellar below, Pettigrew was sent to investigate.\n\nThe noise they had heard was the house-elf Dobby Apparating away with some of the prisoners in the cellar. When he opened the door, he was tackled by Ron and Harry, who had freed themselves of their restraints. Ron managed to wrestle Pettigrew's wand from him. Pettigrew began to strangle Harry, but Harry reminded him that he owed him a life debt, as he had previously saved Pettigrew's life when Remus and Sirius had attempted to kill him. When Pettigrew hesitated, his brief moment of mercy caused his silver hand to turn on him, strangling and killing him, despite Harry and Ron's best efforts to restrain it.[1]\n\nDespite Pettigrew living his life full of cowardice, opportunism and betrayal, the Sorting Hat had always considered its choice of sorting him into Gryffindor as correct. The Hat took Pettigrew's hesitation to kill Harry as evidence of his innate bravery, which many remained doubtful of.[13]\n\nHarry, while disliking Pettigrew for his despicable cowardice and betrayal, nevertheless felt some pity for the way he had to die, and was perhaps one of the few to accept Pettigrew's subtle regret of his life choices.[1]\n\nPettigrew was a very short man (no taller than Harry Potter or Hermione Granger in their third year) with grubby skin, small watery eyes, and a pointed nose, all of which were lingering attributes of his Animagus rat form. He even spoke in a squeaky voice, which was another lingering attribute of his rat form. In his youth, his hair was mousy brown, but by his mid-thirties, it had thinned, lost a lot of its colour, and acquired a large bald patch.\n\nHe was also described as \"fat\" in his youth, but when forced to return to his human form in the Shrieking Shack, he looked as though he had lost plenty of weight in a short time, mostly due to his stress of fearing Sirius Black's wrath. The stress he endured also apparently caused him to appear middle-aged by his mid-thirties. In 1981, he cut off his right index finger as part of a ploy to fake his own death, which was reflected in his \"Scabbers\" form, and, fourteen years later, he cut off his entire right hand at the request of Lord Voldemort. Voldemort used magic to give Pettigrew a shining silver, glove-like replacement. As a Death Eater, he bore the Dark Mark on his left inner forearm.\n\nPeter Pettigrew was characterised by weakness and cowardice. Despite having been Sorted into Gryffindor, he was not especially brave, possibly proving that the Sorting Hat saw potential in him rather than any actual inborn courage, potential that he never lived up to. The Sorting Hat may have mistaken his adoration of James Potter and Sirius Black for steadfastness, or sensed in him a desire to surround himself with respected individuals and believed that he would make a compatible friend to a Gryffindor; Pettigrew clearly looked up to strong, courageous people and it is possible that the Sorting Hat put him there because he wished to absorb that quality.\n\nPettigrew was a Hatstall, being considered between Gryffindor and Slytherin by the Sorting Hat, though the Hat ultimately decided that it made the right choice, which it continued to believe to this day, citing the manner in which Pettigrew died as (what some would call dubious) evidence.[13]\n\nIn his youth, he latched onto James Potter and Sirius Black, who were both more talented and popular students, idolising them and living vicariously through their accomplishments, as well as joining them in bullying other students, such as Severus Snape. Due to their huge differences in terms of talent, bravery, and popularity, Peter was more of a hanger-on than an equal. However, the three Marauders did love Peter as a friend and brother, which made his eventual betrayal of James especially bitter.\n\nPettigrew defected from the Order of the Phoenix and betrayed his closest friends to Lord Voldemort, believing that there was nothing to gain from opposing the Dark Lord while expressing his fear of being killed by him.[12] Even Voldemort viewed him with disdain; the only reason why he kept him alive was because he occasionally proved to be useful.[22] When Voldemort fell, Peter neither attempted to find him nor tried to murder Harry Potter under Albus Dumbledore's watchful eye until he was sure Voldemort would be revived to protect him. When cornered by Sirius and Remus Lupin, Peter shamelessly begged for mercy, despite having used and betrayed them.\n\nPettigrew was an opportunist who allied with the side that seemed strongest and appeared to be winning — thus becoming \"friends\" with James and Sirius in school, and then leading him to become a Death Eater when the opportunity arose. He was loyal only to himself and acted in whatever his best interest was at the moment. He expected that he would be rewarded for leading Voldemort to Harry Potter, and later had the same expectations with Bertha Jorkins, assuming Voldemort would reward him for capturing a Ministry of Magic employee, despite not knowing the extent of her usefulness.\n\nHe only returned to a broken down Voldemort because he had no other choice, as the other side was aiming to kill him, and would have gone anywhere else if he had more options, seeing Voldemort at the time as too weakened to be the victorious side, along with the task of caring for his lord being tedious and unpleasant.\n\nIn spite of others claiming that Pettigrew was a \"weak, talentless thing\", he was at least cunning enough to escape his former friend Sirius after Voldemort's first defeat, frame him for his crimes, and fake his own death while killing twelve people with one curse, living for years in his Animagus form. He originally formulated his plan to return to the Dark Lord without being accused of being a traitor by his colleague Death Eaters: to turn Harry in as a welcome back present and be honoured above all others. Though this was a well thought out plan and he waited patiently, it was upset when Pettigrew's form was exposed prematurely. He also managed to manipulate Bertha Jorkins to accompany him with ease when he brought her to Lord Voldemort. He was also adept in the Dark Arts, powerful enough and malicious enough to use the Killing Curse on Cedric Diggory. In moments of desperation, Pettigrew was willing to amputate his own limbs to serve his purposes, such as his finger to fake his death and his hand to revive Voldemort, the latter being promised with a worthy reward.\n\nHe was, however, foolish enough to stop by an inn for food en route to returning to Voldemort, which led him to run into a Ministry employee. If Pettigrew had not been cunning enough to persuade Bertha into his trap, he might have exposed his own duplicity to the world at large then, as Voldemort noted. Despite Pettigrew's cowardly streak and his repressed regret of his treachery, he was ruthless and callous towards others if it benefited himself, as he massacred twelve Muggles to frame Sirius,[5] murdered Cedric Diggory in cold blood per Voldemort's orders,[22] and would have throttled Harry had he not been reminded of the life debt he owed.[27]\n\nHowever, Pettigrew did feel some regret for betraying his friends, and he hesitated to kill Harry when reminded of his life debt in 1998. Though he quickly tried to undo the moment of weakness, his \"tiny merciful impulse\" resulted in his being strangled to death by his own silver hand.[1] Pettigrew also suggested that Voldemort should find another enemy to use for his rebirth, though when Voldemort began to suspect that he cared about Harry, Pettigrew hastily claimed that Harry meant nothing to him. This suggested that he may have consciously felt some gratitude towards Harry for sparing his life. He also expressed his disapproval of Voldemort killing Bertha, allegedly because her disappearance would not go unnoticed, though whether he felt regretful for taking her to Voldemort is unknown.[22]\n\nThough he valued his own life more than the lives of his friends, Pettigrew felt guilt for betraying Lily and James, but did not have the courage to admit his treachery until it was forced out of him, or to turn against Voldemort until he was reminded of his life debt. He did feel rather under-appreciated when Voldemort claimed him to be an unintelligent and disloyal servant when comparing him to Barty Crouch Jnr. and also seemed resentful that he was treated as little more than a servant for Severus Snape, though he refrained from complaining too much when Snape threatened to request more dangerous assignments for Peter. Without James, Sirius, and Remus protecting him, Peter found no courage to go against Snape, who would in turn bully him in return throughout their time as Death Eater colleagues.\n\nDuring his time as Scabbers the rat, under the Weasley family's care, Pettigrew was lazy and unmotivated, as all he did was sleep and eat. Percy Weasley noted that he could be motivated with cheese as a reward.[21] However, he once bit Gregory Goyle's knuckle on his owner's behalf. This could be because Pettigrew enjoyed being pampered and waited on hand and foot, believing that, as a pet rat, he did not have to do much and could relax instead, at least until Sirius's escape from Azkaban prompted him into action. Even after returning to his Death Eater services, he continued to show certain levels of laziness and carelessness that led to mistakes, such as foolishly stopping at an inn for food while on his way to Albania, which led him to meeting with a Ministry employee and former schoolmate, or neglecting his duties of guarding Barty Crouch Snr, which allowed him to escape.\n\nPettigrew also developed a bit of nosiness, having been eavesdropping behind doors during his stay at the Snape family house at Spinner's End, resulting in Severus slamming the door in his face. Pettigrew was so meek that he did not dare request for reassignment when Voldemort sent him to assist Snape, with Snape treating him as a mere slave for household chores.[26] His unenthusiastic and careless attitude for more risky missions led to the Death Eaters perceiving that Pettigrew could not be trusted with important tasks, resulting in him being assigned the menial tasks of serving his colleagues instead.[28][27]\n\nPettigrew was one of only two known Death Eaters who dared refer to Voldemort by name,[5][29] the second being Barty Crouch Jnr.[22][29] However, Pettigrew still flinched when Sirius said the name during their reunion in the Shrieking Shack.\n\nDespite Professor Minerva McGonagall claiming that Peter was less talented than his friends, and Voldemort later denoting him as a poor wizard, he showed a surprising amount of magical capability when pushed. It is likely that Pettigrew was always a skilled wizard, but his potential or power was overshadowed by that of his friends and peers and by his shy personality. This would become apparent as he grew into adulthood and gained further experience. From what was known, Peter was remarkably skilled in magic and seemed to be as magically skilled as the other three Marauders, and was quite adept in the Dark Arts (perhaps the most capable of the four in that aspect).\n\nPeter Pettigrew's relationship with his parents is unknown, but after Pettigrew faked his own death, the Ministry gave an Order of Merlin to Mrs Pettigrew along with her son's finger — the biggest part of Peter that was found. It is also unknown if his parents knew about his faked death.\n\nDuring his seven years at Hogwarts, Peter came to greatly admire James Potter and Sirius Black for their popularity and magical ability, as well as James's renowned skills as  Chaser for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Though they accepted him as a friend and included him in their various mischief-making endeavours, it was clear he was considered more of a hanger-on than an equal. Nevertheless, they were close throughout their time at school. When they discovered that a member of their group, Remus Lupin, was a werewolf, they illegally became Animagi so as to be able to accompany Remus while he was in his transformed state, rather than shun him as many would have. The four of them eventually came to be known as the \"Marauders\". While James, Sirius, and Remus considered Peter a true friend and would have willingly died for him, Peter proved that he lacked any similar conviction or sense of loyalty.\n\nSome time after joining the Order of the Phoenix, Pettigrew defected from it and joined the Death Eaters. Peter betrayed James and Lily Potter, who entrusted him to be their Secret-Keeper when they cast the Fidelius Charm. Peter later framed Sirius for the crime by pretending to confront him, then cutting off his own finger before taking his rat Animagus form. He killed twelve Muggles in the process, and landed Sirius in Azkaban for twelve years. Sirius had convinced James to use Pettigrew as Secret-Keeper in what he believed to be a brilliant gambit. This was proven to be a fatal mistake that Sirius would regret for the rest of his life. When Sirius learned the truth, he became obsessed with avenging the deaths of his friends. Remus, unaware of the truth until twelve years later, thought Peter died in a heroic confrontation with Sirius.\n\nWhen Peter's treachery was revealed to James's son, Harry Potter, both Sirius and Remus showed no mercy nor sympathy for Peter's lack of courage (if anything, both were disgusted by him), and were absolutely intent on killing Peter, only being stopped by Harry's insistence that Pettigrew was not worth their becoming murderers. As Remus had forgotten to take his Wolfsbane Potion in the wake of discovering Pettigrew's continued existence, he transformed under the full moon and was completely uncontrollable. Peter was able to escape, but, for his freedom, he owed Harry a life debt that would later cost him his own life. Peter's escape led Sirius to remain a wanted fugitive for another two years, and only Harry, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Albus Dumbledore, Remus and, later, members of the second Order of the Phoenix knew of his innocence for those two final years.\n\nWhile they were students at Hogwarts, Pettigrew, along with James Potter and Sirius Black, enjoyed tormenting Severus Snape. Pettigrew, who probably would not have fared well duelling with a wizard as skilled and powerful as Snape, only got away with doing so because he had more talented friends backing him up.[6]\n\nWhen the Dark Lord later assigned Pettigrew to work as his assistant, Snape took to treating him like a slave, forcing him to clean his house and serve food to his guests, while refusing to let him in on their meetings. Pettigrew, though very dissatisfied with Snape's abuse, found little courage to argue or request the Dark Lord for reassignment, and seemingly had to obey out of fear of Snape, as he flinched as though Snape threw something at him when ordered to serve Bellatrix Lestrange and Narcissa Malfoy wine and could not look at Snape eye-to-eye when protesting. Severus did not condone Peter's habit of eavesdropping, even slamming the door in his face to get him to stay away from listening any further. With the feeble protests Pettigrew made proving his ineptitude and cowardice, Snape openly and contemptuously mocked him for it, showed his \"assistant\" no respect whatsoever, and regarded him as negligible vermin. Like the rest of the Death Eaters and Order of the Phoenix alike, Snape would address Pettigrew as \"Wormtail\" instead of his real name during their later years of life.[26]\n\nPeter first met Lily Evans during the Sorting Ceremony at Hogwarts, during which they were both Sorted into Gryffindor. Peter regularly took part in bullying her then-best friend Severus Snape, and, as such, he did not make any better an impression on her than James Potter or Sirius Black did. After Lily ended her friendship with Snape, she eventually married James. She seemed to be much closer to James's circle of friends by that time, especially when they all joined the Order of the Phoenix. She even affectionately referred to Peter as \"Wormy,\" from his nickname \"Wormtail,\" and noted that he \"seemed down\" on the week before Harry Potter's first birthday, as she related in a letter to Sirius. She would not have known that it was because he was enlisted by the Death Eaters and playing spy. Peter, out of fear of his own life, and what Sirius described as the \"finest moment of [his] miserable life\", betrayed Lily's location to Voldemort without a moment of hesitation.\n\nHarry Potter initially believed Peter Pettigrew had been courageous for challenging the alleged traitor, Sirius Black, despite appearing so comparatively timid and weak, with Harry even comparing him to his own friend Neville Longbottom. As Scabbers, Harry felt that Hermione Granger should at least feel responsible when Crookshanks allegedly ate him, when in truth Peter had faked his death for a second time. Though he was disgusted by Pettigrew's disloyalty and cowardice when he learned the truth, he could not stand to see his father's two best friends become murderers, and requested that they leave Pettigrew to face the Aurors instead. Pettigrew managed to escape, leaving Harry unable to prove his godfather, Sirius Black's innocence. However, because of Harry's intervention to save Pettigrew, the latter owed Harry a life debt. Harry, on the other hand, felt regretful for sparing Pettigrew's life and did not want such a bond.\n\nOriginally, Peter spared no thought on betraying Harry and his family to Voldemort, and even prepared to turn Harry in the moment he caught wind of the Death Eaters regaining momentum as a welcome-back present. However, perhaps due to this debt, Pettigrew consciously felt gratitude towards the boy, as he suggested that Voldemort should use another wizard's blood for the rebirth ceremony and hastily implied that Harry meant nothing to him when Voldemort raised the issue, an act that seemed to be denial rather than honesty. Of course, Voldemort also saw this as an attempt for Wormtail to desert him once more out of sheer regret of ever returning.\n\nA year later, Pettigrew met Harry again in the Little Hangleton graveyard, where Pettigrew bound Harry to Tom Riddle Snr's grave and then cut Harry's arm to use his blood in a potion that would restore Voldemort to his former glory. Throughout this meeting, Wormtail struck Harry for struggling, but did not make eye contact when returning Harry his wand, per Voldemort's orders. Pettigrew's life debt was finally repaid during a skirmish at Malfoy Manor, when his momentary hesitation to strangle Harry was interpreted as a sign of weakness by the silver hand he received from Voldemort, and it turned on him. Though both Harry and Ron Weasley attempted to stop it, Peter Pettigrew was strangled to death by his own hand.\n\nWhile digging a grave for Dobby, Harry gave a small thought about Pettigrew, being one of the few people who came to realise the subtle regrets the man had for his life choices, showing that Harry felt a certain degree of pity for him, especially for the way he had to die. Despite this, however, it was not enough to earn Harry's full forgiveness.\n\nAfter framing Sirius Black for the crimes of betraying James and Lily Potter and murdering twelve Muggles, Pettigrew went into hiding in his Animagus form, and disguised himself as a rat named Scabbers. He came into the possession of Percy Weasley, who eventually handed him down to his younger brother Ron. Thus, Pettigrew was in the Weasley family for twelve years, which was in Sirius's perspective a \"curiously long life for a common garden rat.\" Despite Ron's frequent complaints of Scabbers having been a rather boring, useless pet, he felt a strong sense of ownership and was at times very fond of him, especially when Scabbers bit Gregory Goyle's knuckle. However, Hermione Granger's cat Crookshanks immediately recognised the rat for who he was and constantly attempted to catch him. This misunderstanding furthered Ron's protective nature over Scabbers. When Scabbers faked his own death by leaving bloodstains on the sheets, Ron assumed that he was eaten by Crookshanks.\n\nRon and Hermione got into such a row over the incident that they almost ended their friendship. Ron later discovered him in Rubeus Hagrid's cabin and was overjoyed, though Scabbers continued to attempt to flee, struggling against Ron's efforts to pocket him and even biting him on the finger, much to Ron's confusion and irritation. When Sirius finally managed to corner the rat, Ron absolutely refused to believe what Sirius and Remus Lupin were telling him until he saw with his own eyes that Scabbers was the traitorous Peter Pettigrew. Ron took this as a personal insult and was too disgusted to respond to Pettigrew's pleas, and even savagely volunteered to act as an anchor alongside Lupin to prevent Pettigrew from escaping. When Remus transformed into a werewolf during their journey back to the castle, Pettigrew did not hesitate in striking down Ron to escape, leaving his former owner to fend for himself against the dangerous beast.\n\nFour years later, when Pettigrew was being strangled by his own silver hand, Ron tried to save him with a Revulsion Jinx, and failed. When Pettigrew died, Ron was somewhat shocked, but was more preoccupied by Hermione being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange.\n\nHermione Granger first met Pettigrew in disguise as Ron's pet rat named \"Scabbers\" in 1991. In 1993, she and Ron nearly ended their friendship, as Ron was convinced that Crookshanks, her cat, had eaten Scabbers. However, they all learned the truth later when Peter Pettigrew was exposed by Sirius Black and Remus Lupin; \"Scabbers\" was Peter Pettigrew, the wizard who betrayed James and Lily Potter to Lord Voldemort. Peter was afraid of Sirius and Remus, and he knew that they wanted to kill him in order to avenge James and Lily. Pettigrew appealed in turn to Hermione, who was horrified and shocked by the entire discovery.\n\nThe last time Pettigrew saw Hermione was in 1998, during the skirmish at Malfoy Manor. Hermione was being tortured by Bellatrix Lestrange while Pettigrew was sent to check on the prisoners downstairs. Pettigrew attempted to strangle Harry Potter, but he momentarily slackened his grip when Harry reminded him of his life debt and was killed for it by the silver hand made for him by Voldemort. Hermione learned about his death after the battle.\n\nWhen Lord Voldemort first began gaining power during the First Wizarding War, Pettigrew switched sides and began secretly serving the Death Eaters. Though he gave valuable information, such as the whereabouts of Lily, James,[5] and Harry Potter, and was granted the Dark Mark that only the inner circle had, Voldemort still showed little respect for Pettigrew's cowardice and disloyalty.[22]\n\nWhen Voldemort met his first downfall, Pettigrew did not try to find his master but instead hid in his Animagus form as Ronald Weasley's pet rat, \"Scabbers\". Pettigrew turned his back on Voldemort for being too much of a wreck to protect him and did not attempt to murder Harry Potter due to this. He only intended to return if Voldemort regained his strength, after which Pettigrew would present Harry as a \"welcome back present\" in order to make it appear that he never betrayed the Dark Lord. However, his plan was ruined when Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban and Pettigrew's duplicity was uncovered, and he had no choice but to flee and seek Voldemort's protection from Black. Though he regretted this decision and attempted several times to escape while flinching and shuddering at any contact with Voldemort's rudimentary body, he ultimately engineered Voldemort's return to physical form, and Voldemort rewarded Pettigrew with a new silver hand for having sacrificed his own. Voldemort also forced Garrick Ollivander to create a new wand for Pettigrew, a favour which the once highly revered Lucius Malfoy did not receive after his wand was destroyed.[22]\n\nVoldemort neither trusted nor respected Pettigrew. He knew that Pettigrew felt no true allegiance to him and kept him only because he was sometimes useful (oftentimes without Pettigrew being the wiser),[22] or having him assigned to menial tasks.[28] He also made it clear just how little he trusted Pettigrew when he designed the silver hand he made to turn on the man for any attempts at treachery; it did just that when it strangled Pettigrew for hesitating to kill Harry Potter in 1998.[27] Based on this, it is possible that Voldemort reacted to Pettigrew's death with indifference at worst, especially since Voldemort had by that point been more concerned with the Elder Wand.\n\nThe Death Eaters held Pettigrew in contempt because it was based on his information that Voldemort met his first downfall at Godric's Hollow. The ones who were imprisoned in Azkaban screamed in their sleep that Pettigrew was a traitor, and, according to Sirius Black, if any of the Death Eaters who had evaded imprisonment had gotten wind that Pettigrew was still alive, they would have tried to kill him. It was for this reason, as much as his fear of retribution from the Order of the Phoenix when Black revealed that Pettigrew had been the Potters' Secret-Keeper, that he disguised himself as \"Scabbers\" for twelve years after framing Black for his crimes. To prevent them from killing him when he would return to Voldemort, Pettigrew had originally planned to bring in Harry Potter to them as a welcome back present to his lord in order to prevent anyone from saying that he betrayed Lord Voldemort.\n\nWhen Pettigrew returned to the service of the Dark Lord, he was assigned to serve his colleagues, such as Severus Snape and the Malfoy family, as a lowly household servant. Both treated him with disdain, much as Voldemort himself did, and insultingly referred to him as \"Wormtail.\" It can also be noted that while he was present at the Death Eaters' meeting at Malfoy Manor, he did not sit at the table amongst them since Voldemort assigned him to deal with a prisoner in the dungeons. Pettigrew appeared to respect the Death Eater Bellatrix Lestrange and her sister Narcissa Malfoy, as he seemed very happy to see them at Snape's house in 1996, although he might simply have been attempting to flatter them or win their sympathy. Their feelings toward Peter are unknown, though Bellatrix may have at least appreciated his role in reviving their master or otherwise resented him for taking so long to do so. Regardless, the sisters took Snape's suggestion of neglecting Pettigrew and went on with their confidential meeting.\n\nDuring the preparations to bring Voldemort back to full power, Pettigrew worked with Bartemius Crouch Junior to subdue Alastor Moody. Crouch, despite his hatred for disloyal Death Eaters, was able to set aside his differences with Pettigrew to work together.\n\nAlbus Dumbledore's relationship with Peter when the latter attended Hogwarts is unknown. They might have shared some degree of friendship, as Pettigrew joined Dumbledore's Order of the Phoenix during the First Wizarding War. After Pettigrew's betrayal, Dumbledore believed, along with the rest of the wizarding community, that Sirius Black had been the guilty party and that Sirius had killed Peter, along with twelve Muggles, after being confronted about his crime.\n\nHowever, he learned the truth in 1994, as well as that Harry Potter had saved Pettigrew's life before he escaped capture. Though Harry was distressed about being unable to prove Sirius's innocence, Dumbledore had the foresight to appreciate the significance of the life debt Pettigrew now owed to Harry. Indeed, it was in remembering his life debt that Pettigrew hesitated to kill Harry during a skirmish at Malfoy Manor in spring 1998, which resulted in Pettigrew being strangled to death by his own silver hand.\n\nMinerva McGonagall was Pettigrew's Transfiguration professor as well as his Head of House. McGonagall thought that Pettigrew \"hero-worshipped\" James Potter and Sirius Black, that he was a \"stupid\" and \"foolish\" boy, and that she was somewhat harsh with him during their time together as student and teacher. However, McGonagall spoke sadly of Pettigrew's death, and for his \"bravery\" in standing up to Sirius Black, who was comparatively far stronger than him and believed to be a Dark wizard, she seemed to regret how she had treated him decades ago. She was unaware that he had been a spy.\n\nIt is unknown how she reacted when she learned that Pettigrew was alive, and that it had been he, not Sirius Black, who betrayed James, Lily, and Harry Potter and killed a dozen people at once.\n\nWhen Peter graduated from Hogwarts, he joined the Order of the Phoenix alongside his friends to combat against Lord Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Shortly after joining, however, Pettigrew betrayed the Order to spy on them for Voldemort, having came to the conclusion that nothing could be gained from defying the Dark Lord. Although the Order came to realise there was indeed a traitor amongst their ranks, none of them suspected Pettigrew at the time. Pettigrew gave greatly detrimental information on the Order to Voldemort, such as Sirius' secret of being an unregistered Animagus, or the whereabouts of the Potters.\n\nPettigrew also had no qualms attacking former Order ally Alastor Moody alongside Death Eater Barty Crouch Jr in his quest to revive Voldemort. Upon the opening of the Second Wizarding War, the reactivated Order of the Phoenix (including both old and new members) knew of Pettigrew's betrayal and held him in contempt for his self-serving cowardice.\n\nJ. K. Rowling has explained Pettigrew's switch of allegiance by saying that he \"out of cowardice will stand in the shadow of the strongest person.\"[36] She also said that James Potter and Sirius Black allowed Pettigrew to be their friend \"in a slightly patronising way\" and that he ended up being a better wizard and better at hiding secrets than they ever knew.[37]",
