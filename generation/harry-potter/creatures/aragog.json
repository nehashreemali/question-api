  "content": "Aragog (c. 1942 – 20 April 1997) was an Acromantula owned by Rubeus Hagrid. Like the rest of his species, Aragog had a taste for human flesh and was able to communicate with humans vocally. In his youth, he was the size of a Pekingese and near the end of his life was about the size of a small elephant with an eighteen-foot leg span.[4]\n\nAragog had a wife, Mosag, and was the leader of a large Acromantula colony composed of all of his sons and daughters.[4] During his life, Aragog was accused of being Slytherin's Monster,[4] although the monster was really a Basilisk.[5] Ironically, all spiders feared the Basilisk, as it was their mortal enemy.[4] After Aragog died, some of his venom was taken by Horace Slughorn.[3]\n\nAragog was originally brought as an egg in a distant land and came to Great Britain in the pocket of a traveller. Somehow, the egg came into possession of Rubeus Hagrid, who at the time was a student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After Aragog hatched from it, Hagrid kept him in a cupboard in one of the school's dungeons, feeding him scraps.[6]\n\nIn the 1942–1943 school year, Tom Marvolo Riddle, a Slytherin prefect and the descendant of school founder Salazar Slytherin who would later become Lord Voldemort, opened the Chamber of Secrets and unleashed the resident monster, the Serpent of Slytherin, upon the castle to exterminate its Muggle-born population, those who were 'unworthy' to study magic.[7] Aragog was framed as being the monster and Hagrid was accused of being Slytherin's heir.[7] Several students were petrified in the school after the monster was unleashed, and after a student named Myrtle Warren died in a bathroom, the school's governors considered closing the school.[5] Tom, who considered Hogwarts his only home, found out about Aragog after discovering the young Hagrid tending to the Acromantula, and realised that he could use Aragog as a scapegoat for the monster's rampage. Tom came to capture the creature, but Hagrid helped Aragog escape to the Forbidden Forest. Hagrid was later punished with expulsion from the school for his alleged role in the attacks and for this course of action.[6] Aragog, meanwhile, was sent to live in the Forbidden Forest.[4]\n\nHagrid, though expelled, was assigned the position of Gamekeeper at Hogwarts, by the intervention of Albus Dumbledore (who suspected and later knew his innocence), thus allowing him to stay in contact with Aragog.[6] Hagrid would visit Aragog now and then, bringing him food. On one particular visit, Hagrid brought Aragog a female Acromantula he could hopefully mate with, Mosag. The two Acromantulas started a large colony comprised of their children. Sometime later, Aragog became blind.[4]\n\nIn 1992, Salazar Slytherin's Basilisk was unleashed on the castle again. This time, however, the rampage did not result in any deaths, only the petrification of several Muggle-born students. Once again the governors considered closing the school due to the attacks. Governors of the school once again accused Hagrid of being the Heir of Slytherin. Hagrid vaguely told Ron Weasley and Harry Potter to 'follow the spiders,' but couched this advice in a statement to Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, as they were both hiding under Harry's invisibility cloak. Though reluctantly, the two decided to continue their investigation of the monster, and follow the spiders like Hagrid had indirectly told them. This led them into the Forbidden Forest.[8]\n\nArriving at Aragog's Lair, they encountered Aragog and his colony. Aragog revealed to them his past, Hagrid's innocence, the discovery of Myrtle's body in the bathroom, and more of Riddle's scapegoating scheme, thus confirming that he was not the Chamber's resident monster. While the ageing Acromantula revealed that all spider species such as his own feared the monster above other creatures and would never speak nor mention its name or anything about it, in no small part due to its malicious nature, he was able to give the boys a small clue: the monster was born in the castle and was an ancient creature that possessed such a terrifying ability and singular viciousness.\n\nAragog then warned the two that while he showed mercy to Hagrid, he would not deny his many children fresh meat if they were hungry—even if the boys were Hagrid's friends. However, thanks to the Flying Ford Anglia, Aragog's children failed to eat the two boys, as they both escaped the forest by flying away in the enchanted car.[4] After this, Harry and Ron actually found the real monster was in fact a Basilisk,[5] and the real heir was Tom Riddle, the true identity of the Dark Lord Voldemort.[7]\n\nRon and Harry's encounter with Aragog and his colony made Ron's boggart manifest in the shape of Aragog, due to his arachnophobia and general fear of the Acromantula eating him.[9][10]\n\nIn 1996, Harry and Hermione Granger, in an attempt to lure Dolores Umbridge into a trap in the Forbidden Forest, took the path towards Aragog's colony, but the immediate danger of running into Aragog's children was avoided when the local Centaurs intercepted them.[11]\n\nThat same year, Aragog contracted an unknown illness over the summer, and despite Hagrid's attempts to heal and comfort Aragog by feeding him giant grubs,[12] he eventually died on 20 April 1997. Before this time, it had been dangerous for Hagrid to go and visit Aragog because, sensing the giant spider's weakness, his family was getting rather restive and were prepared to eat Aragog’s corpse if they had to. When Aragog died, Hagrid was able to get Aragog's corpse out of the colony before his children could attempt to cannibalise his corpse, though barely as they would no longer hold back in an attempt to devour Hagrid. Aragog was buried in a deep pit near Hagrid's house the next evening. Aragog's funeral was attended by Hagrid, Harry, and Professor Horace Slughorn, who took the opportunity to 'acquire' Aragog's highly valuable venom.[3]\n\nOn 2 August 1998, the Acromantula colony was forced out of the Forbidden Forest by Voldemort, his Death Eaters and his assembled army of Dark creatures, who then established their camp there as a prelude to the Battle of Hogwarts. Aragog's children survived, however, and invaded Hogwarts, attacking both the Death Eaters and the defenders of Hogwarts.[13] It is unknown if the colony and its population survived following the conclusion of the battle, which was in favour of the Order of the Phoenix.\n\nIn 1993, Aragog was described as being roughly the size of a small elephant, with a grey and black hairy body, with milky white eyes, as he was blind.[4] However, it was likely his eyes were formerly black, like most other Acromantulas.\n\nAragog had a close friendship with his former owner, Hagrid. He admitted that it would have been his instinct to try to attack humans, but he restrained himself out of respect and gratitude for Hagrid, and unlike the Basilisk herself, he never personally harmed a human in his life. He was presumed to be a good father to his many children, understanding their taste for human flesh and allowing them to attack and eat anyone they wanted when they were hungry. Hagrid was the only human that Aragog stopped his sons and daughters from attacking. One such case of this was when Ron Weasley and Harry Potter found Aragog, however, this was more than likely an act of parental care as opposed to anger or hatred as Ron comes to think. However, the two managed to escape by sheer luck, as the Weasleys' enchanted Ford Anglia emerged to extract them from the danger.[4]\n\nAragog, like all spiders, feared Basilisks (though the personality of the Basilisk lurking in Hogwarts was most likely a contributing factor), and would not speak of one, not even to Hagrid himself, even though he had asked him about the creature many times. The way that Aragog would not speak their name or of them was similar to the way that wizards and witches (amongst other creatures like house-elves and goblins) would not speak Voldemort's name, or discuss him even obliquely any more than was absolutely necessary, which was appropriate since he himself commanded the creature in his youth.[4]",
