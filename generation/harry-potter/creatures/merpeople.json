  "content": "A merperson[5] (plural merpeople[6]) was a sentient magical beast that lived underwater. They were found all over the world. Their customs and habits were mysterious, and, like the centaurs, were offered the being status but refused in favour of beast, as they did not want to be placed in a status with hags and vampires. Merpeople could breathe above the water for a time, but it was unclear if they could ever truly leave their habitat.[1]\n\nMerpeople were creatures resembling half-human, half-fish hybrids (though they were not, in actuality, half-breeds). Like humans, merpeople came in a variety of appearances.[1] For instance, the majority of the Great Lake Selkie colony had green hair, yellow eyes, and grey skin. Purplish hair was also noted.[7] They also had mainly silver tails. It is very unlikely a human, or even other types of merpeople, would resemble that,[6] proving that mermaids had individuality in their looks and races and subspecies, just like humans.\n\nMerpeople also seemed to be taller than humans, with seven feet appearing to not be an unusual height, at least for a Selkie.[6] Harry encountered one in the lake near Hogwarts who was seven feet tall with a long green beard and a choker of shark fangs, carrying a spear.\n\nMerpeople were divided up into various sub-species or races, depending on where they live. The earliest merpeople lived in Greece, and were known as sirens. In modern times, merpeople living in warmer waters took on a more beautiful appearance, while those in colder waters, such as the Selkies of Scotland and the Merrows of Ireland, were less attractive.[1]\n\nMerpeople were a sapient species, and would qualify for full being status if they did not, as a race, reject the classification. Although their exact level of intelligence as compared to humans was unknown, they possessed many traits beyond those of mere animals, as they had a developed language, Mermish, and had even created music (which they were known, as a whole, to be fond of).[1]\n\nMerpeople were famous for their warlike tendencies and their tendency to drag people underwater to their deaths. As a result, encountering a colony of Merpeople can be intimidating if not life-threatening. All subspecies of Merpeople, including Merrows, Selkies, and sirens, were responsible for the deaths of many hypnotized sailors.[8]\n\nEvidence that the merpeople had a thriving culture was that they lived in highly organised communities, some containing elaborate dwellings made of stone, and had been known to domesticate creatures such as the Grindylow, Hippocampus, and Lobalug (the latter being used as makeshift weaponry).[1] Other signs of their intelligence included jewellery and weapon making, production of art (both paintings and statues), and an ability to understand basic human communication via gestures.[6]\n\nThe merpeople dated back to ancient Greece, where they were first known as sirens. By the modern era, however, merpeople had spread worldwide.[1]\n\nThe history of merpeople's relations with wizardkind, or at least the wizarding British government, were somewhat rocky. Chief Elfrida Clagg refused to accept merpeople as beings under her definition of the term as those who could \"speak the human tongue\". She thought Mermish to be inadequate as it could not be understood by creatures above water. Her decision upset both the merpeople and their allies the centaurs.[1] Though they were allowed being status under Minister Grogan Stump's revised 1811 definition of the term, they would eventually request to be classified as beasts once more, objecting to the fact that dark creatures such as Hags and Vampires also claimed that status.[1]\n\nThe International Confederation of Wizards invited sirens and merfolk to a summit in 1692 to discuss the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy, and the sirens and merfolk helped the Confederation solve the problem of concealing the existence of the various wizarding creatures from Muggle eyes. It was likely because of this help that Minister Grogan Stump granted the merfolk legal protections in 1811, and the Café L'Air De La Sirène was named as such for the same reason.[9]\n\nDespite being considered beasts at the time, a delegation of merpeople were persuaded to attend the 1692 summit of the International Confederation of Wizards, where they would help decide what to do on the matter of hiding the existence of various magical creatures from Muggle comprehension.[1]\n\nAt some point in the 1800s, Mirabella Plunkett, a witch, fell in love with a |merman living in Loch Lomond. When her family disapproved of their marriage, she Transfigured herself into a haddock and vanished.[3][4]\n\nDuring Dolores Umbridge's career in the Ministry, she suggested that merpeople to be rounded up and tagged, as her irrational revulsion to anything that have a part-human appearance. However, the ludicrousness of such an act caused it to never be put into effect.[10]\n\nA colony of merpeople lived in the Black Lake on the grounds of Hogwarts Castle.\n\nThey played a role in the Second Task of the 1994 Triwizard Tournament. They agreed to keep four people in an enchanted sleep in their village for an hour, and protect them until the champion sent to save them arrived. They watched the champions swim around, with spears clutched in their hands, and tried to stop Harry Potter when he tried to save more than one person.[6]\n\nA portrait of a mermaid could also be found in the Hogwarts Prefects' Bathroom.[2]\n\nOddly enough, merpeople were not represented in the Fountain of Magical Brethren at the Ministry of Magic. This could not be simply because they have declined formal \"being\" status with the Ministry of Magic, because centaurs made a similar decision and were represented in the Fountain.\n\nMerpeople's relationship with wizardkind was said to be an unstable one.[11] This could have stemmed from a number of reasons, perhaps because certain people in the wizarding society looked down upon merpeople and saw them as inferior. That was a common occurrence in regards to sentient creatures that were not classified as human. There was a constellation that seemingly depicted a merperson.[12]\n\nDespite the rocky relationship that did exist, merpeople were shown to help humans sometimes, such as agreeing to be a part of the Second Task of the Triwizard Tournament.[6] They were also capable of showing respect to wizards who had earned it; during the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, merpeople were present from within the Black Lake.[7] There was even at least one known case of an African Merperson allowing a wandmaker to use one of their hairs as a wand core.[13]",
