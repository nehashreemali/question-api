  "content": "A kelpie was a shapeshifting water demon native to Great Britain and Ireland.[1] According to Murphy McNully, 34% of all suspicious aquatic mysteries were perpetrated by a kelpie.[3]\n\nAble to take any form, a kelpie usually chose that of a horse with a bulrush mane. After luring unwary travellers onto their backs, they dragged them underwater and ate them, allowing the entrails to float to the surface of the water. A kelpie could be rendered docile and harmless by using the Placement Charm to put a bridle over the creature's head.[1] A bridled kelpie could be considered completely tamed if it allowed a human to ride on their back without attempting to eat them. If a bridle was left on for long enough, some kelpies could remain tame even when the bridle was removed.[4]\n\nKelpie hair could be used as a wand core, although it was said to be an inferior substance when compared to the three Supreme Cores.[5]\n\nIn 1927, Newt Scamander kept a male kelpie in his apartment's basement. He tamed it with a bridle, though he did not use a Placement Charm, riding it instead.[6][7]\n\nA kelpie was kept in the Hippogriff Clubhouse at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry at least in the 1980s.[8]\n\nA kelpie resided in the Magical Creatures Reserve after their previous owner donated it to Hogwarts, hoping it would find a happier home there.[4]\n\nDuring the 1992–1993 school year, Harry Potter's second year, Gilderoy Lockhart gave Rubeus Hagrid unsolicited advice about getting kelpies out of a well, which Hagrid found irritating.[9]\n\nOn 29 June 1997, when Harry and Albus Dumbledore had to cross the black lake in the Horcrux cave, Harry thought that the lake might hold kelpies, as well as other aquatic beasts such as water monsters, giant serpents, demons and sprites.[10]\n\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, a kelpie appeared in the Great Lake. Many believed the kelpie was involved in the unwitting journeys of several students into the lake, when in reality it was Elspeth MacGillony who put the Imperius Curse on the students. The kelpie later brought a student into the lake to let them see the chest that held the crown of courage.[11]",
