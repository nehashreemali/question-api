  "content": "Crookshanks was Hermione Granger's pet cat. He was half-Kneazle,[2][3] as evidenced by his lion-like appearance, ability to solve problems on his own without aid or teaching, and clear dislike of and ability at recognising untrustworthy persons (even if they were in their Animagus forms).\n\nIn August 1993, Crookshanks was purchased from Magical Menagerie by Hermione Granger. The saleswoman from whom she had purchased him stated that he had been in the shop for a long time as \"nobody wanted him\".\n\nCrookshanks played an important role in the events that took place on 6 June 1994. During the height of the Second Wizarding War, Crookshanks stayed at The Burrow. It is unknown what happened to him after the war, but it can be assumed that he was returned to Hermione.\n\nOn 31 August 1993,[9] Hermione Granger, along with her friends Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley, visited the Magical Menagerie in Diagon Alley as Hermione sought an owl. Upon entering the shop, Crookshanks leapt from his cage hanging from the ceiling and jumped onto Ron's head, startling him, before starting to chase Scabbers, Ron's pet rat, out of the shop.[4]\n\nThe proprietor informed Hermione that Crookshanks had been there for quite some time and that \"nobody wanted him\". Knowing this, Hermione decided to purchase Crookshanks, much to Ron's displeasure.[4]\n\nBefore the start of the 1993–1994 school year, Crookshanks began targeting Scabbers, Ron's beloved rat, who was, in reality, Peter Pettigrew in his Animagus form. This started when Ron brought Scabbers into the Magical Menagerie, as the rat appeared unwell after the Weasley family's trip to Egypt, which took place on the same day Crookshanks was purchased.[4] Afterwards, Crookshanks actively sought out Scabbers, even attacking him in Ron’s presence, causing the rat to hide in various places.[10] Hermione brought Crookshanks with her to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and he was present on the train when Dementors boarded in search of Sirius Black, an Azkaban escapee. Perhaps due to his half-Kneazle lineage, the newly adopted cat displayed an ability to detect frauds masquerading as animals, most notably Animagi.\n\nCrookshanks would even attempt to sneak into the Gryffindor Boys' Dormitory to seek out Scabbers.[11] He got another opportunity during Christmas when Hermione brought him into the boys' dormitory.[12] These constant attacks led to frequent arguments between Ron and Hermione. Early in the second term, when Ron discovered blood on his bed sheet and found Scabbers missing, he became convinced that Crookshanks had eaten him.[13]\n\nThis led to a row with Hermione until Scabbers was eventually found at Hagrid's Hut. However, Crookshanks was not the only one pursuing Scabbers. That year, Sirius Black attempted to enter Hogwarts Castle after escaping from the wizarding prison Azkaban, intending to capture Pettigrew, who had framed Sirius for the betrayal of Harry's parents, James and Lily, to Lord Voldemort as well as for the murder of twelve Muggles on a crowded London street during the First Wizarding War.\n\nAt some point during the year, Crookshanks encountered Sirius Black in his Animagus form, a stray black dog mistaken by Harry for the Grim. He eventually trusted Sirius and met with him several times on the Hogwarts grounds, even stealing the passwords to Gryffindor Tower from Neville Longbottom to help him gain entry into the castle.\n\nLater, Crookshanks helped Sirius freeze the Whomping Willow by pressing the knot to reveal the secret tunnel and assisted in luring Harry, Ron, and Hermione through the tunnel into the Shrieking Shack. During the scuffle between Harry and Sirius, Crookshanks attempted to steal Harry's wand and attack him. When both efforts failed, he positioned himself over Sirius's heart. This hesitation on Harry's part provided enough time for Professor Remus Lupin to arrive and reveal the truth about both Sirius and Scabbers (Peter Pettigrew).\n\nCrookshanks led the way back through the tunnels. However, when Lupin transformed into a werewolf, Pettigrew stole Lupin's wand and stunned both Ron and Crookshanks before escaping. After these events, Ron accepted Crookshanks as a remarkable animal companion, seeking his \"judgment\" of the small owl, later named Pigwidgeon, that Sirius had offered him as compensation for the loss of Scabbers to confirm that the owl wasn't another Animagus.[14] Crookshanks showed no reaction to the tiny owl, leading them to decide that there was nothing wrong with it.\n\nCrookshanks soon became more friendly towards others; for instance, he once curled up in Harry Potter's lap while Harry was waiting to hear from Sirius. Another night, before the second task of the Triwizard Tournament, he also cuddled into Harry's lap when he was alone in the Gryffindor common room looking for a way to breathe underwater.[15]\n\nHowever, he remained unusually perceptive and disapproving of bad behaviour, evident in the way he stared at Harry and Ron as they made up answers for their Divination homework.[15]\n\nGinny Weasley, whom Ron claimed was a great lover of cats,[16] seemed fond of Crookshanks. She enjoyed playing with him and was able to coax him out in the kitchen of 12 Grimmauld Place during a meeting of the Order of the Phoenix by rolling Butterbeer corks for him to catch.[17] Crookshanks had a fondness for chasing Wizard's Chess pieces, often needing to be restrained in their presence. He was wary of Fanged Frisbees and hissed whenever one came near. At a Gryffindor party, he followed Ginny around, his yellow eyes fixed on her new pet Pygmy Puff, Arnold.[18]\n\nDuring the height of the Second Wizarding War, Hermione and Crookshanks came to stay at The Burrow. However, Hermione left with Harry and Ron after the wedding reception of Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour was interrupted by Death Eaters.[19]\n\nIt was unknown what became of Crookshanks after Hermione was forced to abandon him during the attack on The Burrow in 1997, as she did not bring him along on the Horcrux Hunt. Most likely, Crookshanks remained at The Burrow under the Weasleys' care until he could be reunited with Hermione after the war. Later on 2 May 1998, in the Battle of Hogwarts, they mentioned him while trying to get past the Whomping Willow.\n\nCrookshanks lived to a very old age, until at some point between 1997 and 2021, he passed away.[1]\n\nCrookshanks was described as very big, bandy-legged, ginger-coloured and with a \"grumpy and oddly squashed\" face. Harry Potter described him as looking as if he had \"run headlong into a brick wall.\"[14] Crookshanks's other most recognisable physical traits were his \"bottlebrush\" tail and his yellow eyes.\n\nBeing half-Kneazle, Crookshanks was more intelligent than an average cat. His intelligence allowed him to help Sirius Black expose Peter Pettigrew, who Crookshanks immediately recognised at first sight, despite Pettegrew always being disguised as Ron Weasley's rat Scabbers. Ron initially thought that Crookshanks simply wanted to eat Scabbers and accused him of being mad.\n\nSirius, on the other hand, claimed that Crookshanks was the most intelligent cat he had ever met. Crookshanks was also very playful and enjoyed catching spiders,[10] chasing gnomes,[20] and attacking chess pieces.[21]\n\nHe was affectionate with those he liked and acted as a shield to Sirius when Harry Potter was planning to kill him. He eventually came to like Harry and would sit on his lap occasionally, as he did in the summer of 1996. However, he could be moody towards those who threw him off their lap, no matter if it was accidental or deliberate.\n\nThe name Crookshanks seems to refer to the cat's bandy legs, from crook, meaning \"a bend\", and shank, a term for the lower part of the legs. It is likely to be derived from the Scottish surname 'Cruikshanks', which is pronounced in exactly the same way. George Cruikshank was a well-known British illustrator in the 1800s and illustrated Charles Dickens's novel Oliver Twist, the first of the famous \"orphan novels\" that influenced J. K. Rowling as she came up with the character Harry Potter.\n\n\"When I was working in London in the late 1980s I used to eat my lunch in a nearby square on sunny days and a large, fluffy ginger cat that looked as though it had run face-first into a wall used to prowl around the sunbathers there; I assume it lived in a nearby house. I didn't ever get close enough to give myself an asthma attack, but I became distantly fond of this cat, which prowled among the humans around it looking disdainful and refusing to be stroked. When I decided to give Hermione an unusually intelligent cat I gave him the appearance of this haughty animal, with the slightly unfair addition of bandy legs.\"[23]",
