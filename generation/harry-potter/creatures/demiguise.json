  "content": "The Demiguise was a peaceful, herbivorous magical beast that could turn itself invisible and see the future, both abilities which made it very sought-after. However, it was difficult to catch and could give a nasty nip if provoked.[3]\n\nIt could be found in the Far East, but only wizards and witches trained in their capture could even see them. It resembled a cross between a sloth and an ape with large, black eyes and long, silky hair.[1]\n\nDemiguise pelts were highly sought after as the hair can be woven into Invisibility Cloaks.[1] Cloaks made from their hair eventually turned opaque, losing their invisibility effects as time passed.[4]\n\nDemiguises had precognitive sight, so that the only way to catch them was to do something completely unpredictable.[5] The Demiguise's ability to make itself invisible was used to symbolise the number zero, in the runic alphabet.[6] Tincture of Demiguise could be extracted from Demiguises and used as a potion ingredient.[7][8]\n\nAt some point before late-1620,[9] Phineas Fletcher smuggled a Demiguise to North America which escaped and bred with a ghoul; their offspring were Hidebehinds,[10] likely the first Hidebehinds ever, as it is unknown whether a union between a Demiguise and a ghoul would happen naturally.\n\nAt some point during the 19th century, a Muggle was lost in the Scottish Highlands tracking a Demiguise. They were using binoculars to track the Demiguise and were confused as to how they could disappear so quickly. Eventually, they ended up losing their binoculars as well. It is not known what happened to the Muggle, but they were likely very confused by the Demiguise.[11]\n\nGladwin Moon's deepest fear was a Demiguise, after encountering and getting traumatised by one in Korea. When Moon's school bully, Piers Pemberton, learned about this fear, he took action by placing Demiguise Statues everywhere, much to Moon's fear and displeasure. Moon, a caretaker at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, asked a student to take the statues down.[12]\n\nMagizoologist Newton Scamander owned a Demiguise called Dougal, who escaped from his suitcase during his visit to New York in 1926 and caused a disturbance in the Ginzberg Delaunay department store while caring for an Occamy that had also escaped. He later found them both with a help of Queenie and Porpentina Goldstein, as well as No-Maj Jacob Kowalski.[13]\n\nAs a child, Jules Egwu considered the Demiguise her favourite creature, as she was then very shy and envied its ability to make itself invisible.[14]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, a Demiguise stole sweets from the area around Hogsmeade and Hogwarts. It was later captured by Jacob's sibling, Penny Haywood, Andre and Jules Egwu. Jules later returned with it to Japan, where she was living at the time, as it was part of the creature's natural habitat range. Her parents were Magizoologists and she planned to ask them to find an appropriate place to release it.[14]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, Professor Silvanus Kettleburn taught his seventh-year students in Care of Magical Creatures how to properly handle and care for the Demiguise.[15]\n\nIn the 2010s, Demiguises were among the various magical creatures that were caught up in the Calamity as foundables. A Magizoologist member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force also accompanied a team on an expedition to China to safely see and then capture a Demiguise.[16]\n\nThe celebrity Magizoologist Naasz owned a Demiguise that became lost during the Calamity, with Naasz offering a large reward for its return. A Calamity Investigator serving as part of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force managed to overcome the Demiguise's precognition and captured it before returning it back to Naasz, who only offered her own autograph in repayment. However, the Calamity Investigator did gain inspiration for catching opponents off guard in combat from their experience with the Demiguise.[16]",
