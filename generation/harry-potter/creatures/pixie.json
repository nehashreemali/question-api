  "content": "The pixie, or Cornish pixie, was a small, bright blue, mischief-making magical beast.[1][2]\n\nThe pixie was able to fly, and was know to have a chaotic flight pattern.[3] They were naughty tricksters who enjoyed lifting people up by their ears and depositing them on the tops of trees and buildings, showing strength for creatures of their tiny size. They could also steal things.\n\nPixies made squeak sounds, and could only communicate with other pixies; their voices were described as \"so shrill it was like listening to a lot of arguing budgies\".[1] Unlike fairies who laid eggs, pixies bore live young.[2]\n\nIn Cornwall in the 17th century, Dymphna Furmage, a witch on holiday, was abducted by pixies. This led to a lifelong fear of them, which drove her to request that the British Ministry of Magic humanely eradicate the pixie species. Her request was declined, and she died in 1692.[4][5][6]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Murphy McNully tried Pixie Spotting with Jacob's sibling and Barnaby Lee in the Magical Creatures Reserve to hone his visual acuity.[3] During the 1988–1989 school year, Patricia Rakepick taught fifth-year students in Defence Against the Dark Arts class how to handle pixies.[7]\n\nOn 1 September 1992, Gilderoy Lockhart brought a group of \"freshly caught\" Cornish pixies to Hogwarts during his tenure as the Professor of Defence Against the Dark Arts. Claiming that they were devilishly tricky creatures, he considered them perfect for a practical Defence lecture. However, he quickly lost control of them and attempted to round them up using the incantation Peskipiksi Pesternomi. This proved ineffective, as Lockhart had most likely fabricated the charm, along with numerous other claims. The pixies picked up Neville Longbottom by the ears and attacked other classmates, who tried to beat them back with their books, before hanging Neville from the ceiling. Lockhart hurried out of the room, asking Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger to \"nip the rest of them back into their cage\". Hermione ended the chaos using the Freezing Charm, enabling her to return the pixies to their cage.[1] Following this, Ron remarked that the only thing he had learned from Lockhart was \"not to let pixies loose\".[8]\n\nDuring the 1993–1994 school year, a water well on the grounds of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry became infested with five swarms of pixies. Harry, Ron and Hermione were tasked to clearing out the infestation with use of the Tickling Charm.[6] During the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May 1998, Harry came across a cage containing Cornish pixies in the Room of Requirement, whilst he was searching for Ravenclaw's Diadem.[9]\n\nDuring the 2008–2009 school year, Professor Kate Brindlemore taught her first-year Defence Against the Dark Arts students about pixies and instructed them to send the pixies back to their cage using the Freezing Charm.[10]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the 2010s, several pixie Confoundables starting appearing throughout the wizarding world, guarding many valuable magical artefacts and object Foundables, ranging from Crystal balls, to Vanishing Cabinets and even the Hand of Glory. Volunteers of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force were sent to deal with these pixies with a variety of spells, such as the Knockback Jinx, Ebublio Jinx and Slowing Charm to immobilise these pixies, and allow for the Foundables to be freed and return to their rightful places of belonging.[11]",
