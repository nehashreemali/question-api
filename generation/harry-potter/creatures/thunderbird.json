  "content": "The Thunderbird was a large, magical avian beast native to North America, and most commonly found in Arizona in the southwestern United States.[1][2] A close relative of the phoenix,[2] the Thunderbird could create storms as it flew and was highly sensitive to danger. A House at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry was named after this creature.[3]\n\nThe Thunderbird was described as having a head that was \"similar to that of an eagle\"; or, in the wizarding world, \"similar to that of a Hippogriff\". They possessed three pairs of powerful wings, and had feathers that shimmered with cloud-like patterns.[1]\n\nThey could create rain storms in their wake as they flew. Notably, if given a potion vial, then the Thunderbird could infuse the potion into the storm, lacing the rain with it. This allowed for the potion to cover a very wide area, affecting everyone under storm. Thunderbirds could also sense danger.\n\nThunderbirds were known to change colours as they summoned storms, their iridescent feathers shifting from various shades of gold to electrifying blue, to grey and silver, to white, and even to deep navy.\n\nThunderbird tail feathers could be used as wand cores; this type of wand was difficult to master, but extremely powerful and well suited to transfiguration. They were also able to sense danger, much like the bird itself, and were able to cast curses on their own pre-emptively if they sensed supernatural danger nearby. Thunderbird feathers could also be used as quills, although this was very uncommon.[4]\n\nShikoba Wolfe, who was of Choctaw descent, was primarily famous for intricately carved wands containing Thunderbird tail feathers. Wolfe wands were generally held to be extremely powerful, though difficult to master. They were particularly prized by Transfigurers.[5]\n\nAround 1926, Albus Dumbledore told Newt Scamander about a Thunderbird captured by traffickers in Egypt. Newt rescued the bird, named him Frank, and travelled to America, intending to return him to his natural habitat in Arizona.[1] He arrived in New York City via a Muggle transatlantic passenger ship, hoping to avoid the attention of the MACUSA, due to then current laws on private possession of magical creatures.\n\nDue to a large number of magical occurrences in New York City during Scamander's visit, culminating in the Obscurial attack on New York, he released Frank over the city, using the Thunderbird's weather related powers to create a large rainstorm laced with Swooping Evil venom. The diluted venom helped obliviate the population, allowing the MACUSA agents to more easily cover up the major potential Statute of Secrecy breach.\n\nAfter his release, Frank flew under his own power and ultimately made it to Arizona.[6]\n\nIn late 1927, Madam Seraphina Picquery, then-president of MACUSA, declared the Thunderbird a protected species, a protection that was later extended to all North American magical creatures.\n\nIn the 1980s or early 1990s, a troubled Thunderbird caused disruptions around Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry during the 1990–1991 school year. Hogwarts gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid and seventh year student Jacob's sibling were assisted by Holly Blackbird in calming down the agitated Thunderbird, who was being harassed by wizard and con artist Todd Cribb, who was placed under arrest after being defeated by Jacob's sibling in a brief duel.[7]\n\nSeveral Thunderbirds lived in Luna Scamander's suitcase. When Luna came to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the 2010–2011 school year to assist Rubeus Hagrid in the investigation of the mysterious infestation of baby Manticores within the school grounds, she accidentally let the Thunderbirds out the suitcase. One of them caught a cold and created a local thunderstorm above Hagrid's Hut.[8]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s or early 2020s, Luna took a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force into the field to learn how to detect, catch, and befriend Thunderbirds, teaching them how to control their mind when vulnerable.[9]",
