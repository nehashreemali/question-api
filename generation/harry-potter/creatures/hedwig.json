  "content": "Hedwig (d. 27 July 1997) was Harry Potter's pet female snowy owl. Hedwig was an eleventh birthday gift from Rubeus Hagrid to Harry. Hagrid purchased her at the Eeylops Owl Emporium.[2]\n\nIn addition to delivering mail, the typical use owls were put to, Hedwig was also a close companion to Harry. She remained one of his closest friends right up to her death during the Battle of the Seven Potters at the height of the Second Wizarding War.\n\nOn 31 July 1991, Hedwig was kept at the Eeylops Owl Emporium until she was purchased by Rubeus Hagrid while he was helping Harry Potter get school supplies in Diagon Alley. She was a birthday present for Harry when he turned eleven. Harry was obviously delighted with his new pet and was very grateful to Hagrid. Harry and Hagrid purchased her from Eyelops Owl Emporium together. This was the first birthday present Harry had ever received, as the Dursleys never celebrated his birthday. He very quickly grew attached to her.[2]\n\nHarry decided to name her Hedwig after an individual he saw mentioned in A History of Magic. In the days before arriving for his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Harry avoided the Dursleys by staying in his room. Hedwig stayed with him during this time, his only friend at 4 Privet Drive.[6]\n\nThroughout her life, she fulfilled the traditional function of an owl by delivering mail for Harry. She spent her years at Hogwarts fulfilling her duties by getting and sending letters to many individuals. In 1991, Harry's first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, she would usually fly in during breakfast to nibble Harry's ear affectionately and have a bit of toast before going off to sleep in the Owlery with the other school owls. The first letter she ever gave him was from Rubeus Hagrid, who invited Harry to have a cup of tea with him and to hear all about his first week at school.[7] At one point, she was tasked with sending a letter to Charles Weasley in Romania asking if he could take Norberta the Norwegian Ridgeback, Hagrid's temporary pet dragon, to Romania.[8]\n\nIn the summer of 1992, Hedwig stayed with Harry at the Dursleys' in Privet Drive again. Vernon Dursley forced Harry to lock Hedwig in her cage, sometimes for weeks at a timem to prevent Harry from sending messages to his \"freaky little friends\". Hedwig started to grow bored and frustrated, a feeling Harry mirrored. He felt forgotten by his friends and mused that Hedwig was the only proof he had that the wizarding world was real.[9]\n\nWhen Ron, Fred, and George Weasley, arrived to rescue Harry from Privet Drive in the Flying Ford Anglia, he nearly ended up forgetting Hedwig when he was getting into the car. She noticed and hooted, waking Vernon up. Harry had to run to get her and put her in the car too. He later let her out, and Hedwig flew behind the car all the way to The Burrow.[10] In subsequent summers, Hedwig's frustrated hooting convinced the Dursleys to allow Harry to let her out to fly on the condition that he didn't use her to send messages. However, Harry sometimes ignored this instruction.\n\nIn the summer of 1993, she took longer to get back to Privet Drive because she decided to fly to Hermione Granger in France to get her birthday gift for Harry. On her way back, she had to help Errol get Ron's gift to Harry when he collapsed. She later went back to Hermione to deliver Harry's letter to her. In her absence, Harry abandoned Privet Drive and went to the Leaky Cauldron. Hedwig, being very intelligent, knew the place she needed to go and arrived at the pub a few minutes earlier than he did.\n\nIn the build-up to the Second Wizarding War, Hedwig was constrained in what she could do for Harry due to the fact that snowy owls weren't native to Britain, which made her conspicuous. This could potentially raise suspicions if onlookers witnessed a snowy owl always going back and forth from a specific location. A specific instance of this was during Sirius Black's evasion of the Ministry of Magic in 1994. Hedwig was keen to deliver messages, but Harry refused to put her at risk, leading to a minor falling out between them.\n\nIn 1995, Hedwig was attacked by Dolores Umbridge or her associates in an effort to intercept Harry's mail, requiring Dobby and Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank to nurse her back to health.[11] Lavender Brown once admitted to Parvati Patil that she always loved Hedwig and thought her to be so beautiful.[12] In 1996, Hedwig brought Harry a brand new copy of Advanced Potion-Making from Flourish and Blotts, which was intended as a replacement for the Half-Blood Prince's copy, but he did not use it nonetheless.[13]\n\nHedwig was killed on 27 July 1997 during the Battle of the Seven Potters. While aboard Hagrid's flying motorcycle with Harry she was struck by a Killing Curse, possibly aimed at Hagrid. She was killed instantly and fell like a rag doll to the bottom of her cage. To add insult to the injury of losing his much-loved companion, Harry was then forced to destroy the sidecar containing Hedwig's body in an effort to slow down the pursuing Death Eaters.[1]\n\nHarry was devastated by the loss of Hedwig. His friends were naturally deeply sympathetic and tried to comfort him. Hagrid consoled him by saying that Hedwig had lived \"a great old life\".[14]\n\nFollowing the Second Wizarding War, Harry continued to keep a snowy owl to honour her.[15] During the Calamity which happened across the wizarding world in the late 2010s and early 2020s, a mysterious Foundable of Hedwig's memory appeared throughout the world, which was trapped in a whirlwind Confoundable. Volunteer wizards and witches of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force could free Hedwig by casting the counter-charm meteolojinx recanto to cancel the effects of the wind and enable Hedwig's memory to return to its rightful place.[16]\n\nHedwig was a very intelligent, loyal, and affectionate companion, and tended to show her affection by gently nibbling Harry Potter's ears or fingers. She also demonstrated that she was fully capable of understanding his wishes and would faithfully follow his orders, such as when he instructed her to find and peck Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger to prompt them to write to him during the summer holidays. Hedwig obeyed Harry's requests, and even pecked Ron and Hermione on Harry's orders in order to get them to write back to him.[17]\n\nHedwig was a dignified and proud creature and was disapproving of less mature owls, such as Ron Weasley's Pigwidgeon.[18] She responded to the hyperactive behaviour she considered inappropriate by staring or hooting reproachfully. She would sometimes show her displeasure physically, turning her back on Harry (showing him her tail), cuffing him with a wing, or even nipping him a little harder than usual if she was offended.\n\nIn particular, she seemed disdainful when Harry had to stop using her to deliver messages to Sirius Black to avoid suspicion, which briefly affected their friendship. Hedwig would also make a lot of noise if she was locked in her cage for too long.[19]\n\nHedwig was a very intelligent owl. When Ron, Fred, and George Weasley came to rescue Harry from the Dursleys in their Flying Ford Anglia, she was still and silent so as to not wake up the Dursleys. She also screeched loudly to alert Harry when he almost forgot to take her with him into the car.[10] Her intelligence also once made her decide to fly to France to get Hermione's thirteenth birthday present to Harry while she was on holiday. Harry relocated to the Leaky Cauldron during Hedwig's journey, but she still knew where to find him. According to Tom, the landlord, she arrived five minutes before Harry did.\n\nFurther evidence of Hedwig's resourcefulness was found in the fact that she didn't need a specific address to deliver messages - a name alone was sufficient. Hedwig was a keen hunter too and, when possible, was allowed to fly outside free and catch food for herself, such as frogs.[20] She would also eat Eeylops Premium Owl Treats.\n\nJ. K. Rowling found the name St Hedwig in a book of medieval saints.[21] It's derived from Hedvig - a Scandinavian name meaning female warrior or battle.[22] There are two female saints named Hedwig:\n\nA St Hedwig's Day dedicated to Hedwig of Andechs has been observed on October 16th every year since she was canonised in 1267.",
