  "content": "A gnome, or garden gnome, was a small magical beast commonly known to infest the gardens of wizarding households.[2][4] The correct taxonomic name for gnomes was, purportedly, Gernumbli gardensi; they were sometimes referred to as Gernumblies.[3] They were found throughout northern Europe and North America.[2]\n\nGnomes could reach a size of approximately one foot, making them smaller than Erklings. They were usually brown in colour and had disproportionately large heads, making them look like potatoes with legs. Although not dangerous creatures, they possessed razor sharp teeth and tended to bite if provoked.[2]\n\nTheir feet were hard and bony, and they did not look anything like the garden gnome lawn decorations used by Muggles (which, according to Ronald Weasley, looked like little Father Christmases with fishing rods).[4]\n\nGnomes lived in burrows underground, known as gnomeholes,[4] where they dug up and ate the roots of plants,[5] creating little heaps of earth around gardens similarly to moles (and as such causing considerable damage to them). Gnomes preferred to live in wizarding gardens over Muggle gardens, and may have ran out and attempted to trip the unwary travellers near the garden they claimed.[6]\n\nGnomes also seemed to like worms[7] and Bertie Bott's Every-Flavour Beans.[8][9] The natural predator of the gnome was the Jarvey, a magical beast resembling an overgrown ferret.[2]\n\nCrookshanks was fond of chasing gnomes around the garden of The Burrow, and the gnomes seemed just as fond of being chased.[10] According to Muriel, gnomes were quick breeders.[3]\n\nAccording to Xenophilius Lovegood, having an infestation of these creatures in one's garden was a sort of blessing. When his daughter Luna was bitten by a gnome, he exclaimed that gnome saliva had many unusual and beneficial properties, such as the ability to suddenly increase one's creativity (in particular, he said it might make one have the urge to sing opera, or give speeches in Mermish).[3] Luna then told Harry that her father had done a lot of research of Gernumbli magic, so at least in the Lovegood's view of things (which always had to be taken with a grain of salt) gnomes may have possessed unique magical abilities, distinct from wizarding magic.[3]\n\nHowever, Rubeus Hagrid considered gnomes \"a nasty piece o' work\" and instructed students to defeat gnomes in his Care of Magical Creatures classes.[11]\n\nBecause of the havoc they wrecked upon gardens and the fact that they were somewhat of a giveaway of wizarding homes,[5] gnomes were deemed pests by the wizarding community. De-gnoming typically consisted of taking hold of the gnomes, swinging them around until they are dizzy, and then throwing them beyond the yard's perimeter fence or wall. Gnomes had the ability to speak, or at least make noises, squealing \"Gerroff me!\" when caught,[4] and could even be taught swear words.[3] They were also able to scream when thrown away and mumble angrily when they were recovering. However they would often laugh when a de-gnoming was not done properly.[4]\n\nInterestingly, the species had such a low level of intelligence that when a de-gnoming was being carried out, they would hurry out of their burrows to see what's causing the commotion, which only rendered them easier to catch. Alternatively, one could use a Jarvey to de-gnome a garden, but this method was considered much too violent and thus was seldom used (Jarveys preyed upon gnomes).[2]\n\nThe Weasleys had to regularly de-gnome their garden by throwing them over the hedge. However, the gnomes always sneaked back in since Arthur Weasley was soft on them and thought they were funny.[4] This may suggest that they had a bit of intelligence, or a more clever sub-species of the gnomes existed.\n\nDuring Sirona Ryan and Philomena's Hogwarts years, they visited Aidan and Dorothy Sprottle's place and listened to a gnome sing poorly.[12]\n\nDuring the 1990–1991 school year, Bill Weasley taught seventh-year Defence Against the Dark Arts students about how to handle gnomes in one of his nightly extracurricular classes, claiming them to be quite dangerous beasts.[13]\n\nIn the summer of 1992, the Weasley family taught Harry Potter about de-gnoming, as their garden at their house The Burrow had become infested with gnomes.[4]\n\nIn the summer of 1994 at The Burrow, Crookshanks, Hermione Granger's pet half-Kneazle cat, enjoyed chasing gnomes around the garden, as he had never seen them before.[10]\n\nIn December 1996, at Christmas, the Weasley family stunned a garden gnome, painted it gold and stuffed it into a miniature tutu in order to use it as a Christmas tree topper. This gnome had also bit Fred Weasley on the ankle as he was pulling up carrots from the garden for dinner. That same holiday, whilst Harry Potter was talking with Rufus Scrimgeour outside, he spotted a gnome poking its head from underneath a frozen rhododendron, and later saw it trying to dig worms out of the frozen ground to eat.[7]\n\nDuring the 2008–2009 school year, one of Rubeus Hagrid's Care of Magical Creatures lessons was to defeat gnomes in order to protect the pumpkins in his garden.[11] Also that year, there were gnomes in flowerpots that were delivered to the Herbology Classroom. When a first-year student tried to get Bowtruckle feed, they had to drive the gnomes away using the Water-Making Spell.[14]\n\nIn April 2020, The Burrow was mentioned as an important historical site in a travel guide titled One Hundred Historical Sites from the Second Wizarding War, leading to a massive influx of tourists visiting the house and a resulting Calamity surge focused on it and its residents. As a result, The Burrow's gnomes temporarily vacated the garden, with Molly Weasley claiming that it was nice to take de-gnoming off of her chore list during the chaos.[15]",
