  "content": "The Blast-Ended Skrewt was a magical hybrid beast bred by Rubeus Hagrid in the autumn of 1994 by cross-breeding Manticores and Fire Crabs.[1][4] Whether Hagrid used magic or somehow got the two different species to mate remains unknown.\n\nNewly hatched Skrewts looked like pale, slimy, deformed ,shell-less lobsters or scorpions. They had legs sticking out at odd angles. They were about six inches long and smelled strongly of rotten fish. Sparks flew out of their rear ends every so often, which propelled them forward a few inches. The males had stingers and the females had suckers on their body to suck blood.[3] The skrewts did not hibernate during winter.[2]\n\nAfter about two months, Skrewts grew to about three feet long and became extremely ill tempered, making it hard to get close to one. They grew grey, shiny armour over their pale bodies and began to resemble a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs. The males held their stingers over their backs and were highly dangerous and repulsive.[5]\n\nAfter several months, Skrewts grew to about ten feet long and were incredibly dangerous (and probably quite lethal). They resembled giant scorpions with stingers curled over their backs. Their shiny armour deflected most spells and they used their blasts to propel themselves at a foe. Their single undefended spot was their armour-less underside.[6]\n\nHagrid began breeding the Skrewts at the beginning of September 1994, ending up with several hundred.[3] At some point, they became too numerous, so Hagrid relocated them to a makeshift nursery in the Forbidden Forest ruins.[7] By the following June, he only had a few left, some of which were later placed in the Triwizard Maze.[6][8] Hagrid never discovered what they ate,[9] although he did mention that he managed to get them to eat ant eggs, Grass Snake, and frog livers to start with, and had his fourth-year Care of Magical Creatures students feed the Skrewts frog livers at the start of the 1994–1995 school year.[3] They often killed each other off, so it is not surprising they died so quickly. It is unknown what became of the last Skrewt.[8]\n\nRita Skeeter claimed that the Daily Prophet had a zoological column every Wednesday and said that the Bang-Ended Scoots could be the event that day if Hagrid gave an interview.[2] However, the Skrewts never did feature in the Daily Prophet's zoological column.[10] Several of these Skrewts were placed inside the Triwizard Tournament maze. Harry Potter defeated one of them by using the Impediment Jinx on its underside.[6]\n\nIn June 1996, following the attack of Stunning Spells on Minerva McGonagall by Dolores Umbridge and other corrupt British Ministry of Magic officials, Ronald Weasley suggested feeding Umbridge to a box of starving Blast-Ended Skrewts as an appropriate punishment. Harry Potter thought the idea \"had its merits\".[11] In 1997, Harry Potter felt that the idea of a teenage Albus Dumbledore \"was simply odd, like trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt\".[12]",
