  "content": "The Thestral was a breed of winged horse with a skeletal body, a face with reptilian features, and wide, leathery wings that resembled a bat's. They were native to the British Isles and Ireland, though they had been spotted in parts of France and the Iberian Peninsula.[1] They were very rare, and were considered dangerous by the British Ministry of Magic.[8] Thestrals were, undeservedly, known as omens of misfortune and aggression by many wizards because they were visible only to those who had witnessed death at least once.[3][9][5][10][2]\n\nDue to Thestrals' classification as XXXX, only experienced wizards should try to handle Thestrals. Breeding as well as owning these beasts might be discouraged or even illegal without Ministry consent; in fact, wizards that lived in areas not protected against Muggles were forced by law to perform Disillusionment Charms on their Thestrals regularly.[2]\n\nA Thestral was also one possible corporeal form of the Patronus Charm[11], and there was a constellation of the animal.[12]\n\nThestrals had quite a disturbing appearance and the wizards who were capable of seeing them often described these creatures as being sinister and spooky. This was because they were seen as having big, bony figures and their dragon-like faces which bore white, glittering eyes that lacked both expression and pupils. Additionally, they were lured by the scent of blood, which was bad for their reputation.\n\nBeing a type of winged horse, most of their anatomy was identical to a horse, excluding their large wings that sprouted from their back. Unlike the Abraxan, another breed of winged horses, Thestral's wings did not possess any feathers at all; they had vast, black and leathery wings that were more similar to those of bats.[2]\n\nTheir fleshless, lustrous bodies were covered with a translucent and glossy coat. This smooth and dark skin was a bit slippery and so thin that Thestral's bones were clearly defined through the entire extension of their sleek bodies. These eerie horses had long black manes, as well as a large tail, either with flowing black hair, like horses or ending in a tuft, like zebras.[13] Another distinction was their sharp fangs used to seize and slash their prey.\n\nThestrals were social creatures who lived in herds. Professor Rubeus Hagrid stated that they were \"dead clever\".[4] In fact, trained Thestrals were smart enough to understand their rider's words when they ask to travel to a specific location.[5]\n\nThese magical creatures could be found in dark environments and the forest was their natural habitat. They communicate with each other through a shrill and strange shriek that resembled some sort of monstrous bird.[4]\n\nThey appeared to be loyal creatures, able to discern a friend from an enemy and offer help to humans in need of transportation. Thestrals would forcefully attack anyone or anything they saw as a threat and in the unusual case of domesticated Thestrals, any enemy of its owners.[14][15] Thestrals were not marks of ill omen, nor (their spooky appearance notwithstanding) were they in any way threatening to humans, always allowing for the fright that the first sight of them tended to give the observer.[1]\n\nIn the Battle of Hogwarts, Hogwarts' trained flock of Thestrals cooperated with Buckbeak, the Hippogriff, to attack the Giants fighting for Voldemort. It's unclear whether or not wild herds could similarly cooperate with other species.[6]\n\nThestrals were carnivorous and attracted to the smell of blood.[1] Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank mentioned that they often attacked birds. This indicates that, naturally, they hunted not only for food on the ground, but also to pursue flying prey.[16]\n\nThe Thestrals that lived within the Hogwarts grounds, in the Forbidden Forest, were properly fed and well trained. They didn't attack other creatures or students unless seriously disturbed.[16]\n\nThe Thestral tail hair was a powerful and tricky substance that could be mastered only by a witch or wizard capable of facing death. It should be noted that this substance could be used as a core in a wand's conception and it was used to create the most powerful wand known by wizards, the Elder Wand.[13]\n\nThe most well-known ability of these beasts was their invisibility to those who had not seen death. In other words, they were only visible to people who had seen someone dying and fully accepted, understood and internalised the concept.[3]\n\nThestrals had an extraordinary sense of smell and would easily recognise the smell of blood and fresh flesh, even if the source of the scent was rather distanced.[4]\n\nThey also had quite a useful sense of direction. The Thestral could understand exactly where their riders needed to go, even if the beast itself might or might not be familiar with the terminus in question. If their riders had a certain destination in mind, they only needed to say the destination and the creature would diligently carry them to the intended location — much like owls do with letters.[5]\n\nThese gentle, winged beasts were very capable and fast fliers and could travel long distances hardly beating their large wings. For example, in 1996, six members of the Hogwarts herd (ridden by Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Ginny Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood) were capable of flying from Hogwarts (Scotland) to the Ministry of Magic (London) in a brief amount of time, with the only trouble they experienced being that they risked falling off the mounts they rode given the beasts' insubstantial physique whilst moving airborne at that speed; and this was even more unsettling for those of them who couldn't actually see the Thestrals. It is possible that they were faster than even the fastest broomstick, as when Harry rode his, he did not think he had ever moved so fast, and he was the owner of a top-of-the-line broomstick, the Firebolt.[5]\n\nTheir powerful wings were capable of lifting, at least, the burden of two humans. They could even lift something that weighs as much as them.[5]\n\nThestrals could be domesticated and mounted, so they were used as an alternative to brooms, Apparition, and other methods of transportation. Once trained, they were very diligent and would quickly carry their owners wherever they wish to go. However, travel by Thestral was technically illegal, as it was a breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.[17]\n\nEven with all their useful abilities, Thestrals were rarely used as methods of transportation due to their reputation as omens of evil and their somewhat dreadful and even distasteful appearance.[4]\n\nWhen riding a Thestral, the traveller usually held onto the creature's mane to ensure balance. To aid the mounting, the wizards also placed their legs behind the wing joints to provide safety. Flying on the back of a Thestral during a long journey was frequently an unpleasant experience, particularly to those who dared riding them without seeing the creature. The high speed flight on an invisible steed could be terrifying. The wind would, eventually, cause a temporary deafness and force the riders to close their eyes. It was often difficult to keep balance on their slick backs.[5]\n\nThe Hogwarts herd was gentle towards humans; they reacted satisfactorily to caresses and avoided attacking owls. However, taking into consideration the Ministry of Magic classification as \"dangerous\",[8] this amiable behaviour might be exclusive to well-trained Thestrals.[2]\n\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry had a very loyal herd of Thestrals used mainly to pull the carriages that lead elder students from Hogsmeade station to the gates of the Castle. To people who couldn't see Thestrals, it appeared that the carriages were autonomous.[3] The herd at Hogwarts started with a male and five females. A number of them had been born since, beginning with one named Tenebrus, which was a special favourite of Hagrid's, the Hogwarts gamekeeper.[4] Harry and a group of students flew Thestrals from Hogwarts to the Ministry of Magic in an attempt to rescue Sirius Black.[5] They were also used by Albus Dumbledore, when he needed to travel but didn't care to Apparate.[18]\n\nRubeus Hagrid, the trainer and breeder of this specific herd, strongly suspected that this was the only large group of trained Thestrals in the whole of Great Britain.[4]\n\nDuring the 1989–1990 school year, Professor Silvanus Kettleburn taught his sixth-year N.E.W.T. students about Thestrals in Care of Magical Creatures, which involved members of the Thestral herd.[19]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War, newly-appointed Headmistress Minerva McGonagall noticed that most students were able to see Thestrals for many years to come. This served as a constant, painful reminder of the cost of all the miseries and sacrifices made to achieve peace.[20]\n\nDuring the 1986–1987 school year, Albus Dumbledore asked Hagrid to give a presentation on Thestrals to the International Confederation of Wizards, hoping to clear up some of the misconceptions around them. More specifically that even a Thestral with limited exposure to strangers will be comfortable working with a large group of them.[21]\n\nTo this end, Hagrid asked Jacob's sibling and Merula Snyde to help prepare a Thestral at the Magical Creatures Reserve for the presentation.[21]\n\nHagrid later reported that he considered the presentation a huge success, though given that prejudices against the creatures still seemed to be common in later years, it's unclear how accurate his assessment was.[21]\n\nHarry Potter first saw the Thestrals at Hogwarts in September of 1995, after having witnessed the murder of Cedric Diggory in June. Harry could not see them that June because he had not yet dealt with what he had witnessed. At first, he wondered why the supposedly horseless carriages were suddenly pulled by such sinister creatures when they were able to move on their own. He pointed the Thestrals out to Ron Weasley, and realised that Ron could not see them. Sensing his desperation, Luna Lovegood assured him that she had always been able to see the horses and that he was just as sane as she was. Given Luna's odd habits and beliefs, this statement did not completely reassure Harry.[3]\n\nThey were first identified by name by Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank, after Hedwig was found injured, when she mentioned that Thestrals sometimes go after birds. They were next mentioned by Hagrid in a Care of Magical Creatures class, where the students were told that they could be used as mounts, and introduced their navigation abilities.[16]\n\nIn June of 1996, Harry, Hermione Granger, Ron, Ginny Weasley, Luna Lovegood, and Neville Longbottom flew to London atop the Thestrals in order to find Sirius Black, whom Harry believed to be in danger in the Ministry of Magic.[5] (Hermione, Ron, and Ginny had trouble mounting their Thestrals for the ride since, at least to the three of them, the Thestrals were invisible).[10]\n\nThe Order of the Phoenix made use of Thestrals in the summer of 1997 during the Battle of the Seven Potters. Six of the Order's members took Polyjuice Potion to disguise themselves as Harry, and then the \"seven Potters\" and their protectors fled 4 Privet Drive to safe houses of other members. Thestrals were used as transportation by the Order, seeing as they are incredibly fast and very clever.  Hermione Granger and Kingsley Shacklebolt flew on a Thestral (Hermione was not confident on a broom), and so did Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour (Fleur did not like brooms).[14]\n\nDuring the second stage of the Battle of Hogwarts, Thestrals were seen attacking Lord Voldemort's Giant soldiers from the air. They were lead by the Hippogriff Buckbeak.[6]\n\nAfter the battle and thus the Second Wizarding War had ended, the great loss of life from the conflict led to more people than ever before gaining the ability to see Thestrals, initially only exacerbating their negative reputation. However, public opinion on Thestrals finally started to soften as a result of activists instituting a series of outreach programmes to combat negative misconceptions about the creatures, leading to Thestrals gradually being treated with more respect than they had been previously and being considered not as unlucky as they were always believed to be.[22]\n\nNineteen years later, James Sirius Potter teasingly warned his younger brother Albus about the Thestrals before they left for Hogwarts. This teasing however was stopped by Harry Potter, by informing his son that Thestrals were not dangerous without reason to be.[15]\n\nDuring the Calamity which affected the wizarding world during the 2010s, Thestrals were amongst the various magical creatures turned into Foundables, guarded by shackle Confoundables, with members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force having to use the Unlocking Charm to release these foundables and return them to their rightful place.[7]\n\nThe name thestral comes from the archaic English word thester, meaning \"dark\" or \"gloomy\",[29] and the suffix -al, meaning \"of or pertaining to\".[30] Together, the name ultimately means \"of/pertaining to the dark\" or \"to gloom.\"",
