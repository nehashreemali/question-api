  "content": "A vampire was a dark magical being that was famed for biting people on the neck and sucking their blood.[6] They were part of the family of beings known as the Living Dead, along with zombies.[7]\n\nAs vampires were magical creatures, they therefore lived in and were affiliated with the wizarding world. There existed a Society for the Tolerance of Vampires,[8] which by its given name, must have campaigned for greater acceptance of vampires and their culture in the magical world, given their seemingly malignant reputation. The wizarding world also set guidelines to prevent exterminating vampires outright.[9] Vampires were studied in first, second, and third-year Defence Against the Dark Arts classes at Hogwarts.[citation needed]\n\nHumanoid, vampires were usually pale and gaunt,[1] with sharp fangs for puncturing the throats of their victims. Vampires Carmilla Sanguina and Amarillo Lestoat died at the ages of 196 and 201 respectively, evidence suggesting they appeared to have a longer lifespan than Muggles and the majority of wizards,[5] despite some of the latter being known to reach a similar or greater age, as shown by wizards such as Armando Dippet and Barry Winkle.\n\nUnlike werewolves, vampires could be both born and turned. Full-blooded vampires were able to pass down their genes and create part-vampires, such as Lorcan d'Eath[10] and Qui LeBlanc,[11] or were able to turn wizards and witches into vampires themselves, such as Victor Ketsueki.[12]\n\nVampires had a very strong aversion to garlic and could be kept at bay by its presence.[4] They drank blood, though they were apparently also able to eat other foods such as pasties,[13] and Honeydukes was known for selling lollipops that tasted like blood, presumably for vampires to indulge in.[14] Hermione Granger was noted for believing this, as revealed when she and Ronald Weasley visited Honeydukes in Hogsmeade in 1993.[15]\n\nDuring the 1473 Quidditch World Cup, seven hundred fouls were committed, one of which involved the release of a hundred vampire bats from beneath the robes of the Transylvanian Captain.[16] The Muggle author Bram Stoker was well known for his 1897 Gothic horror novel Dracula, which features Count Dracula, a fictional character based on the historical vampire Vlad Drakul, the father of Vlad the Impaler.[5]\n\nIn a 1913 Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson taught by then Professor Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, an unidentified student's Boggart took the form of a vampire, their worst fear. When the student cast the Boggart-Banishing Spell, the charm transformed the \"vampire\" into the humorous form of a buck-toothed bunny rabbit.[17] During the 1920s, The New York Ghost ran an article entitled \"Love at First Bite: The Unlikely Tale of a Vampire\".[18]\n\nOne Hallowe'en in or before the 1990s saw a vampire running amok in Great Britain among Muggles, before it was lured away from a Muggle girl with a raw steak.[19]\n\nProfessor Quirinus Quirrell claimed to have encountered vampires in the Black Forest during his break from teaching to gain \"hands-on\" experience in dealing with the Dark Arts. Whether this was true, or merely a cover to hide his encounter with Lord Voldemort in Albania, is unclear.[20] He decorated the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom with cloves of garlic, supposedly to ward off a particularly vicious Romanian vampire.[4]\n\nGilderoy Lockhart wrote a book titled Voyages with Vampires about his supposed encounters with vampires. The book included the account of a vampire who, after an encounter with Lockhart, could eat nothing but lettuce.[21] As Lockhart was known for taking credit for the accomplishments of other wizards, this incident likely happened to someone else.[22]\n\nIn the spring of 1994, Professor Remus Lupin assigned his third-year students an essay on vampires, with Neville Longbottom being unsure whether vampires needed to eat garlic for it to affect them.[23] After Lupin was forced to resign from his position as Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher following Professor Severus Snape's revelation that he was a werewolf, Dean Thomas joked that the class might get a vampire as a teacher next.[24] At the 1994 Quidditch World Cup, a young wizard boasted to several Veela that he was a Vampire Hunter and had killed about ninety vampires by that point.[25] Such acts were illegal under Paragraph 12 of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans.[9]\n\nIn a Daily Prophet article published in the summer of 1995, Rita Skeeter complained that the British Ministry of Magic wasted time arguing over cauldron thickness when they should be \"stamping out vampires\". Percy Weasley angrily rejected the criticism, pointing out that Paragraph 12 of the Guidelines for the Treatment of Non-Wizard Part-Humans clearly forbids such a policy.[9] In 1995, Rubeus Hagrid had a disagreement with a vampire in a pub in Minsk while en route to parley with the giants.[26] During his History of Magic O.W.L., Harry Potter suspected his answer to the question about how the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy was breached in 1749, and the measures introduced to prevent a recurrence, was incomplete. He thought vampires were involved, but could not recall the details.[27]\n\nEldred Worple spent time living among vampires and wrote a Magizoology book, Blood Brothers: My Life Amongst the Vampires. Worple, a friend of Horace Slughorn, brought a vampire named Sanguini to the Slug Club Christmas party at Hogwarts in December 1996.[1]\n\nLuna Lovegood believed that Rufus Scrimgeour was a vampire. Xenophilius Lovegood, her father, wrote a lengthy article about him for The Quibbler after he became Minister for Magic, though according to Luna, the Ministry forced him not to publish it. This was possibly done to prevent defamation of Scrimgeour, but the Lovegoods took it as confirmation of their theory.[1]\n\nVampires were among the various magical creatures that threatened the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy] during the Calamity, which mysteriously affected the wizarding world in the 2010s. They appeared as Foundables, and their Confoundable guards had to be overpowered by volunteer wizards and witches of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[28]",
