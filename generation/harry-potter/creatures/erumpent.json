  "content": "The Erumpent was a huge grey African magical beast.[1]\n\nIt resembled a rhinoceros with a roundish body.[2] It was a powerful creature, with a thick hide capable of repelling most curses and charms, a single long horn, and a thick tail. They were treated with great caution and respect by African wizards and witches.[1] Male Erumpents produced musk.[2]\n\nThe Erumpent did not attack unless provoked, but the results were usually fatal. The horn could pierce skin and metal, and the horn contained a deadly fluid that caused whatever was injected with it to explode. There were rare occasions when the injected object or being did not explode, as in the case of Wilfred Elphick, the first wizard to have been gored by an Erumpent. As his Chocolate Frog Card depicted him in bandages, but very much alive, it can be presumed that he survived the attack and did not explode.\n\nWhen Newton Scamander's Erumpent injected its fluid into a tree on the night of 6 December 1926, it did not explode right away. Instead, it liquefied like glowing bubbles before exploding and fell to the ground.[2] Erumpent numbers were not large, because male Erumpents were frequently blown-up during mating season. Erumpents only gave birth to one calf at a time.[1]\n\nErumpent horns, tails, and Exploding Fluid were all widely used in potions, although they were listed as Class B Tradeable Materials.[1] An Erumpent was one rare possible corporeal form of the Patronus Charm.[4] Female Erumpents could reach five times the size of a non-magical hippopotamus, though it was considered medium-sized in Magizoology.[2][3] Apparently, Erumpents could hold their breath and swim underwater.[5]\n\nIn the 12th century, Wilfred Elphick became the first wizard to be gored by an Erumpent; which was an extremely unlikely event, given the fact that the horn of an Erumpent almost always exploded on contact and Elphick survived the event.[6][7]\n\nIn 1926, a female Erumpent was one of the magical beasts that escaped from Newt Scamander's suitcase and rampaged through New York.[5] She was found in the Central Park Zoo near the hippopotamus enclosure. Newt Scamander attempted to coax her back into his case using a combination of Erumpent musk and a mating dance. However, Jacob Kowalski accidentally spilled musk on himself when he was hit by a fish thrown by an escaped seal. The Erumpent proceeded to chase Jacob out of the zoo and down onto the frozen pond in Central Park. Newt was able to quickly pursue them and pull the Erumpent back into his case.[3]\n\nAt some point, Xenophilius Lovegood acquired an Erumpent horn and kept it in his house, believing that it belonged to a Crumple-Horned Snorkack.[8] When Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger visited him in 1998, Hermione warned him to get rid of it but Xenophilius maintained his ignorance and insisted it was a horn from a Crumple-horned Snorkack. When Harry, Ron, and Hermione realised that Luna was missing, and Xenophilius was planning to trade Harry for Luna, they tried to escape before the Death Eaters Xenophilius had called could arrive. Fearing they would get away, Xenophilius attempted to stun Harry, but instead he hit the Erumpent horn, which exploded and blew up a sizable portion of his house.[9]\n\nAt some point during the early 2010s, an Erumpent was involved in an incident with a poacher and a Muggle safari tour group that was dealt with by Long Shouren.[10]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s or early 2020s, Rolf Scamander taught Magizoologist members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force about his grandfather's techniques for understanding the mind of an Erumpent.[11]\n\nFollowing several reports of exploding caravans as a result of transporting Erumpent horn, the International Magical Trading Standards Body wrote a paper stating that grinding Erumpent horn made it far less volatile for travel. Members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force read this paper, enabling them to better utilise Erumpent horns when brewing the Tonic for Trace Detection, decreasing the amount of time it took to brew the potion.[11]",
