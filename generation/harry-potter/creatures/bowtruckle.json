  "content": "The Bowtruckle was a hand-sized, insect-eating, tree dwelling magical beast with long sharp fingers (two on each hand), brown eyes, and a general appearance of a flat-faced stick figure made of bark and twigs, which served well as camouflage in its natural habitat.[2]\n\nThe Bowtruckle could be found in western England, southern Germany, and certain Scandinavian forests. A group of Bowtruckles was called a branch.[3]\n\nA Bowtruckle served as a tree guardian for its home tree. Notably, a Bowtruckle only made its home in tree whose wood was of wand quality[4][5] (such as a Wiggentree). They never nested in mundane trees.[6] It was generally a peaceful creature, but it would defend its home rather aggressively, attempting to gouge out an attacker's eyes if anything threatened its tree or itself.[2] It was also adept at dodging most types of charms.[7] In order to take leaves or wood from a Bowtruckle's tree, a wizard or witch had to offer it some of its favourite foods; woodlice[2] or fairy eggs,[4] as a distraction.\n\nThe twig-like fingers were well adapted for digging out woodlice from trees and could also be used as a weapon against a foe when aimed at the eyes. Their long, thin fingers were also excellent for lock picking.[2]\n\nHogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry had a Bowtruckle Island at the Great Lake. Newton Scamander used to go to it when he attended Hogwarts, and gained the trust of the Bowtruckles. In between February and June 1913, he took Leta Lestrange in an effort to cheer her up.[8]\n\nNewt Scamander kept a branch of Bowtruckles in his suitcase by December 1926.[9] In 1929, another branch of Bowtruckles lived on a bonsai tree in La Fameuse Fougère. An unnamed Bowtruckle was also spotted in the display window of Aux Vantaux Venteux.[10]\n\nDuring the 1987–1988 school year, Bowtruckles were studied by fourth-year Care of Magical Creatures students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, taught by Professor Silvanus Kettleburn, who described them to be slipperier than Frog Spawn Soap.[11] One of Kettleburn's personal Bowtruckles was named by Jacob's sibling, and was named either Jacob, Barnaby Junior or Newt, after a person of the same name.[12]\n\nBowtruckles were studied by fifth-year Care of Magical Creatures students at Hogwarts during 1995–1996 school year, taught by substitute Professor Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank.[4]\n\nIn 2008, a new first-year student helped Professor Longbottom water Bowtruckle saplings in the Herbology Classroom. He suggested they use the Water-Making Spell instead of a watering can. When they tried to water a sapling, they accidentally hurt it which made it angry. Neville intervened and apologised, offering a treat as a peace offering before it decided to gouge out their eyes.[13]\n\nIn the 21st century, a branch of bowtruckles was unleashed as a Confoundable by the Calamity and had to be dealt with by the Statute of Secrecy Task Force and returned to the Black Forest in Germany. Luna Lovegood also took a Magizoologist member of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force into the Forbidden Forest in search of Bowtruckles, teaching them the incredible concentration and care required to locate such small creatures.[14]\n\nThe word \"bow\" was an old Scottish dialect means \"dwelling\", and \"truckle\" means \"limb of tree\" in old English dialect. This means \"to take a subordinate position\". In Hindi translation of the fifth book, it's called \"Kaashth'jeev\", which loosely translates to \"wood (of tree) creature\".",
