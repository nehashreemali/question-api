  "content": "Broomsticks, also known as brooms, were one of the means employed by wizards and witches to transport themselves between locations. Wizarding broomsticks, unlike non-magical brooms, were enchanted to fly, allowing for a witch or wizard to travel to their destination through the air, as well as for playing broom games such as Quidditch.[1]\n\nThe earliest recorded use of the broomstick was in 962 in a German illustrated manuscript.[1] Only wizards and witches appeared to use broomsticks in the wizarding world. House-elves, for example, Apparate.\n\nBrooms were sold in broom shops and sporting goods stores in the wizarding world. Their use in Great Britain and Ireland was regulated by the Ministry of Magic's Broom Regulatory Control.[2]\n\nSince no spell was devised by wizards to enable them to fly[1] (with the exception of Lord Voldemort in 1997,[3] and Severus Snape a year later)[4] they had to come up with another way to do so. Animagi who transformed into winged creatures, like birds, enjoyed the sensation, but they were rare.[1]\n\nLong before the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy came into force, wizards were savvy enough to realise that Muggle neighbours would seek to exploit their abilities. Therefore, if they were to keep a method of flight in their homes, it would have to be unobtrusive and easy to hide. The broomstick was ideal — it was portable, cheap, and required no explanation. However, the first broomsticks were uncomfortable.[1]\n\nRecords showed that witches and wizards in Europe were using brooms as early as AD 962. A German manuscript of this period showed three warlocks dismounting from their brooms with looks of exquisite discomfort on their faces. The first brooms bewitched were neither comfortable nor aerodynamic (they had rough twigs at the end and unvarnished handles), and in 1107 Scottish wizard Guthrie Lochrin wrote of the \"splinter-filled buttocks and bulging piles\" after a short ride from Montrose to Arbroath. The charms on the broom were also basic; they would move at one speed and could only go up, down, and stop. Wizard families generally constructed their own brooms, so there was a variation in speed and comfort depending on the skill of the builder. By the twelfth century, wizards began to barter services, and skilled broom-makers could trade their services for goods such as the potions of a neighbour.[1]\n\nUntil the nineteenth century, broomsticks were of varying quality, although the invention of the Cushioning Charm in 1820 by Elliot Smethwyck greatly enhanced the quality and comfort of the rides. However, they were still handmade by single wizards, and they were generally incapable of achieving high speeds and were difficult to control at high altitudes. They were also designed with styling and craftsmanship in mind, and not performance. Brooms such as the Oakshaft 79, the Moontrimmer, and the Silver Arrow all made an impact on the broom market, but were still made by single wizards and witches.[5]\n\nIn 1926, the brothers Bob, Bill, and Barnaby Ollerton formed the Cleansweep Broom Company, and the racing broom was born. Their first model, the Cleansweep One, was produced in large quantities and was an instant hit. Three years later, in 1929, Randolph Keitch and Basil Horton formed the Comet Trading Company and released the Comet 140 with a patented Horton-Keitch Braking Charm. For several years, the Cleansweep-Comet rivalry dominated the field, until the creation of the Nimbus Racing Broom Company in 1967. The Nimbus brooms combined reliability and easy handling, and became a favourite for Quidditch teams across Europe.[5]\n\nUniversal Brooms Ltd was a broomstick manufacturing company which was very popular in the past, but eventually shut down in 1978 due to heavy losses, both financial and in popularity.[5]\n\nIn the 1890s, according to Albie Weekes, any broom flew perfectly at low altitudes, but speed consistency tended falter as they rose. Weekes did develop some enchantments that could have been used to upgrade a low quality broom, but in the same manner as upgrades made to a car, it did need some fine tuning. A wizard who tested out an upgraded broom reported that it fared well enough, though it was a little turbulent, and wanting for a bit of speed. It also tended to drift a bit to the left on certain turns and slight swoosh was heard when it dropped. There were some naysayers who were opposed to the idea of upgrade enchantments on brooms. According to Weekes, some people got set in there ways and worried that fiddling with what was working fine would somehow ruin it. Weekes believed that such people did not have proper appreciation for the sense of freedom that came from a quality broom, nor did they appreciate all that was involved in the creative process.[6]\n\nEventually, nearly every wizarding household in Britain owned at least one broomstick.[1] Dedicated riders kept their brooms in top condition with a Broomstick Servicing Kit.[7] Instead of broomsticks, wizards in Asia and the Middle East generally preferred to use flying carpets (a notable exception being Japan), which were outlawed in Britain, where they were classified as Muggle objects,[1] Despite the popularity of mass manufactured broomsticks, there may still have been a market for individual artisans even into the 1980s. Rowan Khanna's uncle was a top broom maker- one of his creations took several months to make and cost several thousand galleons.[8]\n\nBrooms had a number of qualities that a potential buyer might consider, including speed, agility, height, stability, resilience, and comfort. All brooms had their advantages and disadvantages. For example, the Oakshaft 79 had great stability, but not much agility, because of which it was not very popular among Quidditch players.[9]\n\nIt appeared that, similar to the stucture and type of wood used in the making wands, the functionality of a broom was also influenced by these same factors. The Oakshaft 79 had a thick oak handle that was designed for endurance flying and withstand high wind conditions. The twigs on a Firebolt could be either birch, which offered more \"oomph\" when ascending, or hazel, which provided better precision turning, depending on what the customer wanted. The Firebolt also had goblin-made ironwork, increasing stability and power in adverse conditions and prevented slippage on the foot grips.[10]\n\nMuch like the quasi-sentience of wands, broomsticks appeared to have a bit of a personality of their own, as they were able to respond to the simplest of commands, such as flying into its owners hand when given the command \"Up!\".[11]\n\nBroomsticks had various spells cast on them to help with riding and flying. Early broomsticks had only simple charms placed on them; a model on display in the Museum of Quidditch only moved forward at one speed and would move up, down, and stop. Over time these spells progressed from simple to more complex.[1] For example, modern broomsticks were versatile and came with a Cushioning Charm.[5] The Cleansweep Eleven notably came with a built-in vibration control feature and an anti-jinx varnish.\n\nSome broomstick models, like the Dark Lightning and the Yew Weaver had a reputation for the dark arts. However, it's unknown if these reputations were actually warranted, or what it entailed if the reputation was warranted.[6]\n\nWhen Harry fell off his Nimbus 2000 during a Quidditch match, it didn't fall to the ground but instead drifted away toward the Whomping Willow,[12] suggesting that it may have had some form of enchantment on it to keep it flying without a rider.\n\nHarry's Firebolt, when held and then released, floated at exactly the right height for him to mount it.[13]",
