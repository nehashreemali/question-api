  "content": "Hermione Granger's wand was 10¾\" long,[4] made of vine wood,[4][5] and possessed a dragon heartstring[6] core.\n\nHermione performed powerful magic with this wand during her time at Hogwarts. She was the first to master the Levitation Charm in her first year in Charms class on 31 October, 1991.[1]\n\nShe was able to produce a corporeal Patronus in the form of an otter at the age of sixteen,[7] a very advanced piece of magic and proof that she possessed superior magical ability.[8] Due to Hermione's talent and hard work she was top of her class in every subject,[9] except Defence Against the Dark Arts, where she came second to Harry Potter.[10]\n\nIn 1996, during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Neville temporarily used Hermione's wand after his wand was broken, and Hermione was incapacitated by Death Eater Antonin Dolohov. His nose was also broken, making it difficult for him to articulate spells. At one point in the battle, when Walden Macnair grabbed Harry by the throat, Neville jabbed him in the eye through his mask with Hermione's wand, making him scream and release Harry.[3]\n\nAfter the battle, Neville returned Hermione's wand to her and purchased a new wand for himself.[11] Hermione used this wand during the Battle of the Seven Potters. She and Kingsley fended off several Death Eaters during the sky battle.[12][13] When the trio infiltrated the British Ministry of Magic to steal back Slytherin's locket from Dolores Umbridge, Hermione used her wand for the mission.[14]\n\nIn December 1997, Hermione had to share her wand with Harry for a time after his wand was broken by the Blasting Curse she used to defend him from Nagini when the snake attacked them in Godric's Hollow.[15] He was still holding it when Ron returned to them, fortunately for Ron, as Harry used it to place a Shield Charm between Ron and a furious Hermione, who was noted to have been angry enough to wrestle her wand right out of Harry's grip. During his absence, Ron had taken a blackthorn wand from Snatchers that Harry was subsequently able to use.[16] Hermione used this wand during the trio's visit to Lovegood House, whilst seeking information on the Sign of the Deathly Hallows, during their visit they were ambushed by two Death Eaters, and just managed to escape.[17]\n\nHermione's wand was confiscated by Snatchers in the spring of 1998 when she, Harry, and Ron were caught after Harry accidentally broke the Taboo jinx by saying Voldemort's name. Hermione subsequently used Bellatrix Lestrange's 12¾\" walnut and dragon heartstring wand, which Harry grabbed during their escape from Malfoy Manor.[2] Hermione disliked having to use Bellatrix's wand, partly because she did not win it herself, making it more difficult to use, and partly because it was the wand Bellatrix had used to torture Neville Longbottom's parents and to kill Sirius Black. However, she was forced to use it.[18]\n\nThis caused a problem when she, Harry, and Ron later broke in to Gringotts Wizarding Bank with Hermione impersonating Bellatrix by consuming Polyjuice Potion. The goblins asked Hermione to see her wand as identification before she could enter the Lestrange family's vault, but Bellatrix had already warned them that her wand had been stolen. Harry was forced to use the Imperius Curse to ensure that Hermione was allowed in.[19]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts, Hermione duelled Bellatrix alongside Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood, holding her own quite well.[20]",
