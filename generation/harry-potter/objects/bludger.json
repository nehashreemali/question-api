  "content": "A Bludger was a black iron ball used in the wizarding sport of Quidditch. It was ten inches in diameter. There were two Bludgers used in every match, which were bewitched to fly around and try to knock the players off of their broomsticks. It was the Beaters' job to protect their teammates from the Bludgers and at the same time aim them towards the opposing players.[1]\n\nEarly Bludgers (known as Blooders) were simply rocks bewitched to chase players around the field. These were eventually too fragile, and could be smashed by a Beater's bat, which ended up with players being chased by flying gravel for the rest of the game. After a few years, Bludgers were made out of lead, which was also too soft for Bludger manufacture. The magically reinforced Beater's bats could dent it, thus impairing their ability to fly straight. All Bludgers are currently made of iron. The history of this latest development was discovered by Agatha Chubb, who discovered sixteenth-century lead Bludgers in an English peat bog.[2]\n\nIn November 1992, Dobby the house-elf magically tampered with a Bludger to make it only chase Harry Potter, while it would normally try to attack all players equally.[3]",
