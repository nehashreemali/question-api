  "content": "Harry Potter's wand was 11\" long, made of holly, and possessed a phoenix feather core.[1] This was described by Garrick Ollivander to be an unusual combination of wand core and wood.[1] The feather was donated by Fawkes, Albus Dumbledore's phoenix.[5]\n\nIt was revealed by Garrick Ollivander that Tom Riddle's wand core also came from Fawkes, making the two wands \"brothers\". Harry's wand was described as being \"nice and supple\".[1]\n\nHarry's wand was broken in December 1997,[6] but was repaired by him after the Battle of Hogwarts on 2 May 1998. Usually the repair of a wand was impossible, but with the use of the Elder Wand it was achievable.[7] It can be assumed that Harry continued to use his wand after this, as he was incredibly fond of it.\n\nOn 31 July 1991, Harry obtained his wand from Ollivanders in Diagon Alley, at a price of seven Galleons, just before his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He had tried out many other wands first with little success, but felt a warm feeling upon being handed the holly wand.[1]\n\nWhen Harry asked why this wand chose him, Ollivander revealed that it was a twin brother to the wand used in the Potter murders at Godric's Hollow on Halloween 1981, explaining that both wands' cores were feathers of the same phoenix. He then subtly revealed the other twin wand's owner and the culprit, Lord Voldemort. Before Harry purchased this wand, Ollivander revealed more of Voldemort's terrible deeds.[1]\n\nDespite his wand being brothers with Voldemort's wand, noted by Ollivander after Harry's wand had been chosen,[1] Harry generally did not put much thought into this connection at first, regarding the relationship as something that the wand could not help, any more than he could help being related to his aunt Petunia Dursley.[8]\n\nHarry wielded this wand throughout his Hogwarts career and demonstrated his growing magical skill, particularly in Defence Against the Dark Arts[9] and duelling. Harry talent for DADA even surpassed Hermione Granger's. He earned an 'Outstanding' O.W.L. in the subject,[10], and even taught fellow students defensive and offensive magic.[11][12]\n\nHarry has also performed powerful magic with this wand. This includes the very advanced Patronus Charm (at age thirteen), something many full grown wizards were unable to achieve,[13][14][15] and an impressive Shield Charm.[16][17][18][19] He also learned many other spells at a young age in order to compete in the Triwizard Tournament.[20][21][22]\n\nWhen Harry entered the Chamber of Secrets and confronted a fragment of Lord Voldemort's soul via his diary Horcrux, the manifested soul took the wand that Harry dropped when he rushed to an unconscious Ginny Weasley, and used it to write his full name in fiery letters and then reorganised them into the phrase \"I am Lord Voldemort\". Harry reclaimed the wand once he destroyed the diary.[2]\n\nHarry attended the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasley family and Hermione Granger. During this time, Barty Crouch Jnr managed to fight off his father's Imperius Curse long enough to take Harry's wand and cast the Dark Mark into the sky with it.[23]\n\nThis caused some Ministry of Magic officials to be suspicious of Harry, after it was discovered, upon using Prior Incantato, that his wand had cast Morsmordre (the spell that conjures the Dark Mark). Winky, the house-elf in charge of keeping young Barty, was found with the wand and was accused by Amos Diggory of being the one who cast the spell. Once the wand told all it could of the crime scene, it was returned to Harry.[3]\n\nWhen Lord Voldemort returned and forced Harry to duel him in the Little Hangleton graveyard, the rare magical effect of Priori Incantatem was triggered. Their wands recognised each other as \"brothers\" and refused to attack one another.[5]\n\nA battle of wills began, and Harry's wand forced Voldemort's to regurgitate its spells, resulting in the emergence of the spirits of: Harry's parents, Bertha Jorkins, Frank Bryce, and the recently murdered Cedric Diggory. After Harry broke off the connection, they lingered for a while to hinder Lord Voldemort and the Death Eaters. This gave Harry enough time to escape.[24]\n\nIn the aftermath of the Triwizard Tournament and Voldemort's return, Harry possessed magical knowledge and experience that could be said to significantly exceed that of his fellow students.[5] He was forced to essentially learn a variety of advanced spells to hold his own during the competition, as he was going up against much older students and facing dangerous tasks.[20][21][22] Harry wielded this wand in many epic conflicts such as that at the Battle of the Department of Mysteries,[18][25] against the Inferi in the Horcrux Cave[26] and during the Battle of the Astronomy Tower.[27]\n\nWhen the Order of the Phoenix evacuated Harry from 4 Privet Drive, they were ambushed by over thirty Death Eaters and Lord Voldemort himself. When Lord Voldemort pursued and attacked Harry and Hagrid, Harry's wand, recognising Voldemort as an enemy as a result of Priori Incantatem from Harry's previous duel with Voldemort in Little Hangleton On 24 June 1995, and acting by itself, despite the fact Voldemort was using Lucius Malfoy's wand instead of his own in order to avoid causing the reverse-spell effect, shot \"a spurt of golden fire\" at Voldemort, destroying Lucius's wand and allowing Harry and Rubeus Hagrid to escape to safety.\n\nDumbledore theorised that this event, which Ollivander himself described as \"unique\", was the result of Harry's wand having absorbed a portion of Voldemort's extensive magical skill during their duel in the Little Hangleton graveyard which it regurgitated upon their encounter.[28]\n\nOn Christmas Eve of that year, Harry and Hermione ventured to Godric's Hollow during their search for Lord Voldemort’s Horcruxes, hoping to speak to Bathilda Bagshot. Voldemort had foreseen Harry's intentions, and had planted his snake Nagini in Bathilda's corpse beforehand. As soon as she had Harry alone, Nagini attacked him. Hermione raced to his defence, using a Blasting Curse to repel the snake. The curse ricocheted, damaging Harry's wand.\n\nHarry asked Hermione to repair it afterwards, but it was too badly damaged, that after two failed attempts at some simple spells it fell apart again. Harry was very upset at the loss of his wand, though he was not angry with Hermione, recognising that she had saved his life. Despite its destruction, Harry kept the pieces of the wand in his mokeskin pouch.[6]\n\nHarry and Hermione took turns using her wand, until Ronald Weasley returned to them carrying wands he had taken from Snatchers. Thereafter, Harry made do with a blackthorn wand, although it did not work as well for him as his own wand had. However, the trio was caught by Fenrir Greyback's Snatcher gang and taken to Malfoy Manor, in the spring of 1998, and all their wands were confiscated.\n\nIn the ensuing fray, Harry disarmed Draco Malfoy and took his wand. The loss of the Holly wand was noted by the Malfoys, who had doubt Greyback caught the real Harry as the wand he was carrying at the time was not the one he was usually using. From this, Voldemort found out that the wand was destroyed, and his fear of the Priori Incantatem was gone.[29]\n\nAfter escaping the Malfoy Manor, Harry requested Mr Ollivander to repair the wand, to which the wand maker stated it was an impossibility by his knowledge. Despite being prepared for this answer, it was still a major blow to him, and he sadly let the topic go.[30]\n\nDuring the Battle of Hogwarts,  Harry duelled Lord Voldemort for the final time. As the Elder Wand, which Lord Voldemort wielded, was loyal to Harry, the Killing Curse directed at Harry rebounded and killed Lord Voldemort. Harry then used the Elder Wand to successfully repair his original wand and planned to return the Elder Wand to the grave of Albus Dumbledore.[7]\n\nIt can be assumed that Harry kept his wand, since he went through the trouble of repairing it and used it during his time as an Auror and as Head Auror. He most likely used it when promoted to head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement in the summer of 2019, as well.\n\nHolly was one of the rarer kinds of wand woods; traditionally considered protective, it worked most happily for those who may have required help overcoming a tendency to anger and impetuosity. At the same time, holly wands often chose owners who were engaged in some dangerous and often spiritual quest.[31]\n\nHarry's wand was well suited to him, in a lot of ways a perfect match. Harry had a notorious temper, that at times made him somewhat terrifying to his friends. He also was shown to be impulsive, making many decisions on the fly. Harry faced a spiritual and dangerous quest when he, Ron, and Hermione went a hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxes. This quest tested his limits and shook the faith he had in himself and those around him, but at the same time made him a stronger individual.\n\nHolly is one of those woods that varies most dramatically in performance depending on the wand core, and it is a notoriously difficult wood to team with phoenix feather. The wood’s volatility conflicts strangely with the phoenix’s detachment. In the unusual event of such a pairing finding its ideal match, however, nothing and nobody should stand in their way.\n\nHarry's wand contained a phoenix feather core, along with the previously mentioned holly wood. Harry was able to perform extraordinary feats with his wand and displayed a relentless determination, proving true the statement that nothing and nobody should stand in the way of this unusual paring of core and wand wood with its rightful match.\n\nHarry Potter owned several different wands up until the end of the Second Wizarding War, though only his holly and phoenix feather wand was considered truly his. Other wands included:\n\nJ. K. Rowling has explained her choice of holly for Harry's wand wood:",
