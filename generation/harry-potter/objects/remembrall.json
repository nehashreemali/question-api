  "content": "A Remembrall was a magical large marble-sized glass ball that contained smoke which turned red when its owner or user had forgotten something. It turned clear once whatever was forgotten was remembered.[1]\n\nRemembralls were also banned in the O.W.L.s because they would be used to cheat. They were banned in the examination hall, along with other items that could be used for cheating, such as an Auto-Answer Quill.[3]\n\nNeville Longbottom received one as a gift from his Gran at the beginning of the 1991–1992 school year. As soon as he held the Remembrall in his hand for the first time, it turned red, indicating he had forgotten something. The problem was he could never remember what it was that he had forgotten.[1]\n\nIt was this particular Remembrall that drove Harry Potter into his career as Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. When Neville accidentally flew into the air in his first flying class, he left it behind when he crashed and broke his wrist. Draco Malfoy took it and threw it high into the air. Harry chased it and caught it just as it was about to smash on the ground. Professor McGonagall saw everything, and was convinced that Harry's natural affinity for flying would serve him well as Gryffindor's new Seeker.[1]\n\nIn the summer of 1992, the Weasley family Puffskein swallowed Ginny Weasley's Remembrall and she got lost in the woods by The Burrow while trying to find it. When Harry found Ginny, she told him her Remembrall was his to keep if he could use a Knockback Jinx on the Puffskein to make it spit it out.[4]\n\nOn the Hogwarts Express on 1 September, 1995, Neville asked Harry to guess what he had gotten for his birthday. Harry suggested that it might have been another Remembrall, thinking of the gift that Neville had gotten in his first year. The actual gift he received was a Mimbulus mimbletonia, but he said that he could use another Remembrall, because he had lost the old one \"ages ago\".[5]\n\nDuring the Calamity which affected the Wizarding world in the 2010s, Remembralls were very minor magical disturbances, appearing as Foundables and guarded by Confoundables, which had to cleared up by volunteer wizards and witches of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force. Sage Bragnam later encountered a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force and trapped them in a relentless conversation about magical artefacts and artefact taxonomy. Although the investigator fell asleep twice during the course of the conversation, their talk did help Sage remember where he had hidden a cache of Remembralls.[2]",
