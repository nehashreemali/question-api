  "content": "The Goblet of Fire was the \"impartial judge\" for the Triwizard Tournament which chose which students would represent their respective schools during the upcoming tasks of the Tournament.[1]\n\nTo put forward their candidacy, students merely had to write their name on a piece of parchment and put it into the goblet's flame. When the time came for the champions to be selected, the goblet would then choose one student from each school by spitting out their name in a rush of red flames. Once chosen, the participants were subject to a binding magical contract in which they could not back out of the Tournament.[1]\n\nThe goblet was described as being made of wood and — when active — had blue-white flames up to the edges, which turned red when someone put their name in or when it spit out the name of a chosen champion. When it was not in use, it was kept in a jewelled casket.[1]\n\nIt acted as an impartial judge. During the 1994 Tournament, an age restriction was added and, as such, an Age Line was cast to ensure that no one under the minimum age could try to put their name into the goblet. Anyone who tried to do so with an Ageing Potion would end up being hit with its flames and forced to age even further to appear like old men, as demonstrated by what happened to Fred and George Weasley when they tried to trick the goblet via that exact method.[1]\n\nThough it was intended to be impartial, it could be bewitched to make decisions that transgressed the rules. Since the goblet was a highly powerful magical artefact, it would require a Confundus Charm of equal or greater power to accomplish this. After the champions were selected, it would extinguish itself and would not reignite until the next tournament.[2]\n\nApparently crafted sometime during the Middle Ages, by 1994, the Goblet of Fire had served as a means of selecting champions for the Triwizard Tournament ever since the contest's establishment.[3] It was contained in an ancient wooden chest encrusted with jewels when not in use.[1]\n\nDue to revised safety precautions, only wizards and witches who had come of age were allowed to enter the tournament. As such, Albus Dumbledore drew an Age Line around the Goblet during the 1994 Tournament to prevent students under the age of seventeen from entering their name.[1]\n\nHowever, Bartemius Crouch Junior, disguised as Alastor Moody, rigged the goblet and the tournament as part of a plan to use Harry's blood to revive the Dark Lord.[4] He jinxed the goblet with an extremely powerful Confundus Charm to make it forget that only three schools compete in the tournament and entered the name of fourteen-year-old Harry Potter under a fourth school. As he was the sole candidate from said fourth school, this resulted in Harry being selected as a fourth Champion in the Tournament, alongside Fleur Delacour of Beauxbatons, Viktor Krum of Durmstrang, and Cedric Diggory of Hogwarts. After the champions had been selected, the flames of the goblet went out and would not ignite again until the next Tournament, much to Igor Karkaroff's frustration, as he wanted to carry on selecting champions until each school had two representatives to even things out.[2][4]\n\nEventually, the Hogwarts professors discovered the plan and captured Crouch Jnr, just as they discovered the abducted real Moody in captivity. What became of the goblet after the 1994–1995 Triwizard Tournament is unknown, though it was eventually rendered effectively useless with the permanent discontinuation of the Tournament following this event.\n\nDuring the Calamity which affected the Wizarding world in the late 2010s and early 2020s, the Goblet of Fire was amongst the various magical items which appeared across the world as one of many Foundables guarded by Confoundables. These had to be overpowered by volunteer wizards and witches who worked for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force, returning these Foundables to their original place.[5]",
