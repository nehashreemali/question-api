  "content": "The Deluminator,[1] also known as the Put-Outer,[3] was a magical device used by Albus Dumbledore (the first known owner and designer of the one Deluminator known to exist) to remove light sources from the Deluminator's immediate surroundings, as well as bestow them.[3] It looked like a standard silver cigarette lighter.[3][1]\n\nDumbledore left the Deluminator to Ron Weasley, in his will (presented by Rufus Scrimgeour), after his death.[1]\n\nIn 1927, Albus Dumbledore used the Deluminator to darken London's streets to talk with Newt Scamander and avoid detection by the Ministry of Magic employees.[2]\n\nIn 1932, Albus used this Deluminator to turn off the street lights of the alternative dimension during his duel with his nephew in Berlin.[4]\n\nOn 1 November 1981, after the murders of James and Lily Potter by Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore used the Deluminator to darken Privet Drive, where the Dursley household was located. Dumbledore was expecting Rubeus Hagrid to transport the infant Harry Potter to Privet Drive, where Dumbledore would leave him at the Dursley household. Dumbledore's Deluminator allowed Hagrid to arrive with added security.[3]\n\nIn 1995, Dumbledore lent the Deluminator to Mad-Eye Moody, who used it when transporting Harry from the Dursleys' home to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix at 12 Grimmauld Place. The Deluminator again provided added security to keep Harry Potter safe, as he was a highly valued target among Lord Voldemort's supporters, and to keep the Order's headquarters secret, because these headquarters were also a highly valued target.[6]\n\nIn 1996, Dumbledore used it again to darken Privet Drive before coming to collect Harry.[7]\n\nIn 1997, the Deluminator was left to Ron Weasley in Dumbledore's will.[1] It seemed to also act like a homing device. Whenever Hermione and Harry mentioned Ron's name, he could hear snippets of conversation before and after, even though he was far away. It then acted as a guide, leading Ron back to Harry and Hermione after he left them following an argument. Ron speculated that this was the true reason that Dumbledore left him the Deluminator: so that he could find his way back to his friends if he ever left them.[5]\n\nIn 1998, Ron Weasley used the Deluminator in the Malfoys' cellar, so that Luna Lovegood, Ollivander, Ron and Harry could see inside the cellar, releasing light that he had earlier taken from the lamps within Perkins's tent. And when Peter Pettigrew came down into the cellar, Harry told Ron keep the lights on, and leave as it is. The lights, being unable to rejoin their sources, simply remained in the room.[8]\n\nOn 31 October 2009, Ron came back to Hogwarts to bring his Deluminator to Headmistress McGonagall so she could take another look at it. On the way there, he travelled past London and used the Deluminator to collect the lights of half a street. When he arrived, he happened to be attracted to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's Deathday Party, where he talked to a student and showed them the Deluminator. When Peeves caused the lights in the party hall to go out, Ron encouraged the student to use the Deluminator to restore the lights.[9]\n\nDuring the Calamity which affected the wizarding world in the late 2010s, the Deluminator was among the many magical items which became Foundables, being guarded by Confoundables.[10]\n\nThe main use of the Deluminator was to take or release light. There was a button on it, and when pressed, would absorb the nearest light source and a light ball would fly towards the Deluminator. If light was already taken, the Deluminator could also release light. The light would go back to their sources if the original source was nearby, otherwise the light would stay at the Deluminator.[3]\n\nThere seemed to be another use as demonstrated by Ron Weasley. Whenever the user's name was mentioned in a conversation, the Deluminator would play the snippet of conversation just before and after the user's name was said. Activating the Deluminator after this allowed the user to Apparate to the location of those speaking about the user even when their exact location was unknown; Ron speculated that Dumbledore specifically left the Deluminator to him for this reason, so that Ron could find his way back to his friends if he ever left them.[5]\n\nIn 1932, Dumbledore used the Deluminator to turn off the daylight of the mirror world and leave a negative image of the real world to show Credence that they had been in an alternative dimension during their duel.[4]",
