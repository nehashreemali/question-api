  "content": "A Pensieve was a very rare and powerful magical item. They were a magical device used to store and review memories.[2][1] Pensieves were rare because only the most advanced wizards ever use them, and because the majority of wizardkind is afraid of doing so.\n\nWhen in use, a silvery light shines from its contents. This light was bright, whitish silver, cloud-like, and moving ceaselessly. Harry Potter thought the content in the basin looked like “light made liquid — or like wind made solid”.[1]\n\nIt had the appearance of a shallow stone or metal basin, into which runes and strange symbols were carved and precious stones were fitted. It was filled with a silvery substance that appears to be a cloudy liquid/gas;[2] the collected memories of people who had siphoned their recollections into it.[2][1]\n\nThe Pensieve was enchanted to recreate memories so that they become re-liveable, taking every detail stored in the subconscious and recreating it faithfully. Once memories were siphoned into the Pensieve, a witch or wizard could enter them by dipping your head in the water and view the memory from a third-person point of view, almost as if travelling into the past. However, since it's just a memory and not actual time travel, the user of the Pensieve was non-participant, meaning that their presence had no effect on anything that happened in the memory. Even more difficult than the recreation of memories was the use of a Pensieve to examine and sort thoughts and ideas, and very few wizards have the ability to do so.\n\nThe Pensieve was also perceived as dangerous, due to its power over memory or thought, owing to the highly personal nature of extracted memories, and the potential for abuse, as one could not only revisit their own memories, but the memories of another person. Inevitably, those with things to hide, those ashamed of their pasts, those eager to keep hold of their secrets, or protective of their privacy, would be wary of an object like the Pensieve.[2]\n\nPensieves were intensely personal, since memories often held recollections of things one would wish to hide or forget. Unless the witch or wizard in question requested otherwise, their Pensieve and all the memories it contained was typically buried with them when they die, same as their wand. However, the Hogwarts Pensieve did not belong to a particular person, but to the school.[2][1]\n\nA Pensieve was located in the Headmaster's office at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where it was used by the various Headmaster and Headmistresses of the school over the years.[1]\n\nPensieve is portmanteau, combining the words ‘pensive’ and ‘sieve.’ The latter is an object in which something may be sorted, drained or separated, and ‘Pensive’ is derived from French, and originally from the Latin ‘pensare,’ meaning ‘to ponder,’ and in common English usage means ‘thoughtful’ or ‘reflective;’ thus a ‘pensieve’ allows for the sorting of thoughts, or memories. Pensive can also refer to a tense mood someone seems to be in, and indeed many of the memories Harry views in it are of tense or awkward moments.",
