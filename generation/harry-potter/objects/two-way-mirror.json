  "content": "A two-way mirror was one in a pair of mirrors that were magically connected. This allowed people to communicate with each other whilst in different locations.[1]\n\nA pair of two-way mirrors, originally used by James Potter and Sirius Black for communication during detentions, later played a critical role in Harry Potter's life. Harry received one mirror from Sirius, which he later smashed after Sirius's death, though he later found and kept a shard. The other mirror was acquired by Aberforth Dumbledore. Harry's broken shard, seemingly useless, eventually allowed him to call for help and see Aberforth's eye, who then sent Dobby to rescue Harry, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Granger from Malfoy Manor in 1998.[2]\n\nDuring the Calamity, which affected the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy in the 2010s, two-way mirrors were turned into Foundables during the Calamity, which subsequently had to be returned by volunteer members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force.[4]",
