  "content": "The Mirror of Erised was a magical mirror, which, according to Albus Dumbledore, showed the \"deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts.\" The name \"Erised\" was \"desire\" spelled backwards, as if reflected in a mirror. The happiest and most satisfied person in the world would look in the mirror and see a reflection of them, exactly as they were, for they would then have no one and nothing more to yearn or desire for that the mirror could ever show them. But of course, it was intrinsically inherent for human nature to desire something greater than one's own self — meaning that an event wherein the mirror failed to carry out its intended purpose rarely, if at all, happened.[2]\n\nThe writing engraved on the frame of the mirror was allegedly in a foreign and probably dead language, but if one looked closely it said \"I show not your face but your heart's desire\" backwards, with the spaces rearranged. Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.[2]\n\nThe Mirror of Erised was created before the end of the nineteenth century. It is unknown who the creator was. The mirror was one of those magical artefacts that seemed to have been created in a spirit of fun (whether innocent or malevolent was a matter of opinion), because while it was much more revealing than a normal mirror, it was interesting rather than useful.[4]\n\nIndeed, it became grimly apparent over the years that the mirror could bring more harm than good; many wasted their lives before the mirror, losing track of reality as they were deluded by what they saw and unable or unwilling to accept it as mere fantasy. Some were even driven mad by seeing their most desperate desire presented before them as a mere image confined within the frames of the mirror, unable to achieve what they were witnessing.[2]\n\nIt is unknown how it came to be at Hogwarts. A succession of teachers had brought back interesting artefacts from their travels, so it might have arrived at the castle in this casual manner, either because the teacher knew how it worked and was intrigued by it, or because they did not understand it and wished to ask their colleagues' opinions.[4] The mirror had been kept in the Room of Requirement since around 1891.[4]\n\nIn September of 1927, the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Albus Dumbledore looked into the mirror and saw his former best friend, Gellert Grindelwald, indicating he still had lingering feelings for him, as well an old memory of himself and Grindelwald in a barn where they made a blood pact; swearing an oath never to fight each other, showing that Albus still valued that memory, manifested before him by the mirror as his greatest desire, of the time when his friendship with Gellert was at its strongest that led to the two of them cementing it with the pact in the first place.[1]\n\nDuring the 1987–1988 school year at Hogwarts, the Mirror of Erised was reported missing, much to Professor Dumbledore's concern. Several Hogwarts students including Jacob's sibling decided to locate the Mirror. After some research, Jacob's sibling and Penny Haywood found the Mirror of Erised in the Herbology Classroom, covered with a sheet before several potted plants, which Professor Sprout had placed there. After speaking to Sprout in the classroom, she admitted to taking the mirror but was upset over having any trouble by taking it, so she went with Jacob's sibling to speak with Dumbledore in the Headmaster's office, where she explained she took it after failing to nurture a Puffapod, and found that her heart's desire was being surrounded by flourishing plants.[5]\n\nHowever, when Sprout and Dumbledore went to return the Mirror in the Herbology Classroom, they found it vanished, much to their confusion. Jacob's sibling found the Mirror in the Owlery where their friend Talbott Winger had taken it to using magic. He told them he saw him standing with his deceased mother and father in the Mirror, with Tulip Karasu adding that she saw herself working for the British Ministry of Magic in the Mirror. Merula Snyde, Ismelda Murk and Barnaby Lee interrupted them with Merula declaring she and her gang intended to take the Mirror so they could see their hearts' desires. They took it to Classroom 3C, where Merula and her gang looked into the Mirror impulsively, where upon seeing their reflections, all left abruptly. Jacob's sibling later spoke to Barnaby in the Care of Magical Creatures paddock, where he told them he saw himself as the Care of Magical Creatures Professor at Hogwarts. Jacob's sibling later met with Ismelda and Merula in the Three Broomsticks Inn, where Ismelda told them how she saw herself telling everyone in her life how she felt over and over, with Merula commenting she saw herself with someone she though she would have never seen again, but refused to discuss any further.[5]\n\nAfter realising that some of their friends wanted to return the Mirror but others refused to part with their visions, Jacob's sibling and Penny spoke to Rubeus Hagrid, and after his advice (along with Dumbledore's), Jacob's sibling managed to persuade their friends in the Owlery not to rely on the Mirror's visions and to focus on their present lives. After returning it to Dumbledore in his office, Jacob's sibling was given the option by him to look into the Mirror or not, and Dumbledore gave them a miniature Mirror of Erised to remind them of their time spent with the Mirror, despite it not possessing the Mirror's magic.[5]\n\nIn 1991, Dumbledore had brought it out, and, tucking it out of sight in a disused classroom, initiated some key modifications to the mirror, so that it could hide the Philosopher's Stone.[4]\n\nThe Mirror was discovered by Harry Potter on the night that he used his father's Invisibility Cloak for the first time, to search the restricted section of the library for information about Nicolas Flamel. In his attempt to stay hidden from Argus Filch, the school caretaker, he stumbled upon the classroom where the mirror was being stored. Upon looking into it, Harry saw his late parents, Lily and James Potter. On his next midnight visit to the mirror, he brought Ronald Weasley, hoping to show him his family. However, Ron saw himself as the Gryffindor Quidditch Captain and Head Boy, holding up the Quidditch Cup, as he has always been overshadowed by his brothers and is always striving to be noticed by others.[2]\n\nOver the next few days, Harry proceeded to visit it as often as he could to see his parents' faces; the Mirror also occupied his thoughts beyond anything else, to the extent that he disregarded Ron's warning that he was growing obsessed with it. Dumbledore found Harry visiting the mirror one night, and after explaining to Harry what the mirror was all about, told him that the mirror was to be moved and requested that Harry not go looking for it again. Before heading back to bed, Harry asked Dumbledore what he saw when he looked into the mirror. Dumbledore claimed to see himself holding a pair of thick, woollen socks, telling Harry that \"one can never have enough socks.\"[2] If this had been true, it would suggest that Dumbledore was so content with life that the only things he wished for were small things.\n\nHowever, Dumbledore was lying — the matter being a very personal one. Unbeknownst to Harry, for a long time, Dumbledore's greatest desire was to be with his former lover, Gellert Grindelwald. But, by 1998, as revealed to Harry, Dumbledore, having come to terms with his guilt over his sister's death, saw his family whole and intact, free of any pain or suffering.[6] It is unknown if Grindelwald, as a redeemed man, was included in these later reflections.\n\nIn 1992, the Mirror was the final guardian of the Philosopher's Stone in its Chambers. Dumbledore placed an enchantment on the mirror, hiding the stone inside of it, and allowing the mirror to transfer the stone only to one who wanted to find the stone but not to use it. Anybody wishing more than simply to find it would see themselves making gold or the Elixir of Life, or in Professor Quirrell's case presenting the stone to his master. This is because the greatest desire of anyone wanting to use the stone would not have their greatest desire to be finding it in the first place; anyone just wanting to find the stone but not use it would thus have their greatest desire to find the stone thus have their wish granted.[3]\n\nWhen Professor Quirrell ordered Harry to look into the mirror, Harry focused on finding the stone, and, uninterested in actually using the stone for his own purposes, saw his reflection pocketing the stone, at which time it magically appeared in his real pocket.[3]\n\nDuring a week in the 2011–2012 school year, Peeves attacked Jenna Hexsmith with water balloons four times while causing chaos at the Hogwarts Gobstone Club. On the fifth occasion, she decided to distract the Poltergeist while her friend went to check on the club. However, the friend got lost and stumbled upon the Mirror of Erised in the History of Magic Classroom, later telling Jenna and another friend, Robyn Thistlethwaite, about the discovery and learning about the Mirror's properties.[7]\n\nProfessor Clodagh Dromgoole later stumbled across the Mirror and saw herself with several lost tomes she had been searching for that she believed she could use to decipher all known runes. Unaware of the Mirror's properties, she believed the vision shown within the Mirror to be real and attempted to figure out how to access the tomes through the Mirror. Jenna's friend ran into Professor Dromgoole and explained the Mirror's properties to her, much to her disappointment.[8]\n\nDuring the Calamity which mysteriously happened across the wizarding world in the late 2010s and early 2020s, the Mirror of Erised was one of the numerous magical artefacts and items that were displayed across the world as Foundables. Volunteer wizards and witches had to cast spells to banish the Confoundables guarding them, to return the Foundables to their rightful places of belonging.[9]\n\nWhen someone looked into the Mirror, it showed them a vision of their greatest desire upon its surface, often with them having achieved some goal or ambition, or, much more rarely (according to Dumbledore), reuniting with lost loved ones. Additionally, what a person desires most can change over time, and by extension, what a person saw in the Mirror can change.[2]\n\nSince each person was unique, only they themselves could see their own greatest desire in the Mirror, and would likewise be unable to see the desire of anyone else who looked in the mirror.\n\nAccording to Albus Dumbledore, the Mirror showed neither truth nor knowledge, only dreams. Dumbledore insisted that it's not good to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Many once great witches and wizards had previously wasted away in front of the Mirror, and some had even gone mad from their own longing.\n\nDumbledore later bewitched the Mirror to hold the Philosopher's Stone, where the only one who could retrieve it from the Mirror would be one who wanted to find the Stone but not use it or have it used.[3]\n\nThe Mirror could seemingly only show the desires of living beings, as the portrait of Severus Snape claimed that he could not see anything in the Mirror despite it being positioned right in front of him.[10]\n\nThe word \"Erised\" (pronounced eer-eh-said) is \"desire\" spelled backwards, meaning the name could also be known as the \"Mirror of Desire\". The backwards spelling symbolises how mirror reflections flip images around (for example, \"erised\" when reflected in a mirror spells \"desire\"). However, because this is no ordinary mirror, the text also shows how the mirror is very different from standard mirrors, in the way that it shows the inner desires and not the outside appearance of a person.\n\n\"Albus Dumbledore's words of caution to Harry when discussing the Mirror of Erised express my own views. The advice to 'hold on to your dreams' is all well and good, but there comes a point when holding on to your dreams becomes unhelpful and even unhealthy. Dumbledore knows that life can pass you by while you are clinging on to a wish that can never be - or ought never to be - fulfilled. Harry's deepest yearning is for something impossible: the return of his parents. Desperately sad though it is that he has been deprived of his family, Dumbledore knows that to sit gazing on a vision of what he can never have, will only damage Harry. The mirror is bewitching and tantalising, but it does not necessarily bring happiness.\"[4]",
