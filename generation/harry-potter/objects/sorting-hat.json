  "content": "The Sorting Hat was a sentient magical hat at Hogwarts that was used to determine which of the four school Houses was the best fit for each new student. These four Houses were Gryffindor, the house of bravery, Hufflepuff, the house of hard work, Ravenclaw, the house of intelligence, and Slytherin, the house of ambition.[2] The Sorting Hat originally belonged to Godric Gryffindor, one of the four founders of Hogwarts.[3] It was normally kept in the Headmaster's office until it was needed for the Sorting Ceremony at the annual Start-of-Term Feast.[1]\n\nThe famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat gave an account of its own genesis in a series of songs.[3] During the opening banquet at the beginning of each school year, the first-year students were lined up and their names read aloud alphabetically by last name. Each then took a seat on a stool and placed the hat on their heads.[2]\n\nThe hat was battered and old by 1991; it was patched, frayed, and extremely dirty. In order to speak and sing, a tear along the brim opened like a mouth. It spoke to the wearer inside of the hat with a small, quiet voice, using Legilimency to interpret their thoughts and respond to them. After a time of consideration, the hat announced its choice aloud for all to hear, and the student joined the selected house.[3] The moment of consideration varied in time period from less than a second to over five minutes (known as \"hatstall\").[4]\n\nThe Sorting Hat was notorious for refusing to admit it had ever made a mistake in its sorting of a student. On those occasions when Slytherins behaved altruistically or selflessly, when Ravenclaws flunked all their exams, when Hufflepuffs proved lazy yet academically gifted, and when Gryffindors exhibited cowardice, the Hat steadfastly backed its original decision. On balance, however, the Hat had made remarkably few errors of judgement over the many centuries it had been at work.[4]\n\nAlthough most people believed that the Sorting Hat used its Legilimency to see which House would be the most suitable for the student, the Hat actually used its Legilimency to see which House the student would be happiest in, which it judged by the student's mental reaction to mention of the House. This, it claimed, was the reason why it was never wrong when picking a House, as it wasn't the Hat picking the House at all but instead the students themselves.[5]\n\nLegend had it that the Sorting Hat was sewn roughly one thousand years ago and began as a normal hat belonging to Godric Gryffindor. When Gryffindor, along with Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff, wondered how they would continue to sort the students when the four were dead, Gryffindor pulled his hat from his head and, along with the other founders, enchanted it with their combined intelligence. All four founders wanted to ensure that students would be sorted into their eponymous Houses, which would be selected according to each founder's particular preferences in students.[3]\n\nThe Sorting Hat, now animated, was able to sort and divide the students into the Hogwarts Houses, and continued to do so for a millennium, passed down to each new Headmaster or Headmistress of the school. When not in use, it is placed on a shelf in the current Headmaster's or Headmistress's office.[1]\n\nThe hat continued to carry out its duty each September at the beginning of the start-of-term feast, when it was placed on a three-legged (sometimes four-legged) stool at the front of the Great Hall.[2]\n\nIn 1858, Angus Buchanan, an eleven-year old Scottish Squib managed to sneak into the feast with the help of his wizard brother and put the Sorting Hat on his head. The Sorting Hat then kindly said he was a good-hearted chap, but no wizard.[6]\n\nThe Sword of Gryffindor, one of the founder's only other known relics, could be magically pulled out of the hat by any Gryffindor considered worthy, no matter how secure the sword's location.[7] It was unknown why this was possible, but was linked to loyalty of the highest regard in relation to Hogwarts. There were two known instances of this happening within 1993 to 1998, once when Harry Potter was in the Chamber of Secrets,[7] and once when Neville Longbottom refused to join Lord Voldemort during the Battle of Hogwarts.[8]\n\nDuring the Calamity in the late 2010s or early 2020s, the Sorting Hat spoke with a Calamity Investigator working for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who was visiting Hogwarts, with the investigator being surprised by its ability to more articulately explain its experience being a Foundable than anyone else they had interviewed. The investigator theorised that the hat's enchanted origins might have enabled it to better understand the Calamity's effects.[9]\n\nThe Sorting Hat and the Sword of Gryffindor were the only two relics that hadn't been turned into Horcruxes by former Hogwarts student Tom Marvolo Riddle during his transformation into Lord Voldemort.\n\nBefore sorting the students each year, the hat recited a new introductory song. These songs vary in length and content though they generally introduced the hat and its role in sorting new students.[2] Ron Weasley expressed the opinion that the Hat spent the entire school year making up its next song.[10]\n\nThey also occasionally warned of danger to come, as in its 1995 song,[11] though it was not known how the Hat was aware of upcoming events. It was suggested that the Hat picks up some of its information from Albus Dumbledore, though it was not known whether it would have done so before such an influential figure in the wider wizarding world was in office.\n\nThe Sorting Hat appeared to have a difficult time in the sorting of Harry Potter. It suggested that Harry would have great fame and glory by joining Slytherin House, as Harry possessed Slytherin qualities such as cunning and determination. Harry requested specifically to be spared that fate. Instead, based upon this choice, the Hat placed him in Gryffindor, where both his parents had also been Sorted.[2] When Harry spoke to the Hat in his second year, it repeated its earlier declarations — that Harry would have done well in Slytherin.[1] This was possibly due to the fragment of Voldemort's soul which lived inside Harry during his sorting; the hat would have registered its presence, as well, noticing Harry's potential.\n\nIn the next year at Hogwarts, the Hat also played a critical role in Harry's success against the Basilisk. Fawkes had brought the Sorting Hat to Harry's aid in the Chamber of Secrets. This provided him with Godric Gryffindor's Sword, which Harry used to slay Slytherin's Basilisk. The sword and hat together are the only two known relics of that wizard.[7]\n\nAlmost two decades after the Battle of Hogwarts, Albus Severus Potter expressed worry over his own Sorting. He indicated that the Sorting Hat might put him in the Slytherin House, and that its judgement may be faulty after being repaired. However, as the hat is said to be old and patched from its first appearance, it would seem this worry is needless. Harry also reassured him that Albus' middle name was named after Severus Snape, a Slytherin headmaster, and Harry would had no hard feelings towards Albus, Slytherin House or the Hat if he was to be sorted to there.[13]\n\nThe Sorting Hat also appeared to have had a disagreement in the sorting of Hermione Granger, as her expansive intelligence made her well suited for Ravenclaw, but it decided to place her in Gryffindor.[14] However, it can be argued that Hermione saw a greater challenge in herself in becoming bold and courageous, some of the traits of Gryffindor House. This can be clearly seen when Hermione doubted books and cleverness as the traits of a great witch and instead shows that friendship and bravery are more important. Hermione also stated that she thought Gryffindor House was by far the best of the four.\n\nIt was not hard for the Sorting Hat to place Ron Weasley, as all the Weasley family have been placed into Gryffindor House. Ron was afraid that he would be the only Weasley not to make it into Gryffindor. Mere moments after the Hat touched his head it announced his house,[2] considering Ron to be \"brave at heart\" and \"daring\".[15] A year later his little sister Ginny was also sorted into Gryffindor.[16]\n\nThe moment the Sorting Hat was placed on Draco Malfoy, the hat instantaneously declared Draco would join the house of Slytherin.[2] In addition to being selfish and cunning, Malfoy was a pure-blood, like most Slytherins. Almost all of his family was sorted into that house, including his parents Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange, as well as a long line of his ancestors from the House of Black.\n\nAccording to Albus Dumbledore, the Sorting Hat declared Tom Riddle a Slytherin almost instantly after it touched his head. He had many of the qualities associated with the Slytherin house, and he was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin himself.[17]\n\nThe Sorting Hat took a long time to decide upon where to put Neville Longbottom. During his sorting Neville argued with the hat, saying he was best in Hufflepuff. The Hat argued otherwise, and declared Neville to do greatly in Gryffindor. Neville was intimidated by Gryffindor's reputation; however, his persistence did not work and the hat successfully sorted him into Gryffindor.[18] Considering the bravery Neville showed in his seventh year,[8] and standing up to Draco, Harry, Ron, and Hermione in his first year, this choice was not regretted.[19][20][21]\n\nIn addition, during the Battle of Hogwarts, Neville was able to draw Gryffindor's sword from the Hat (if done so, the person was considered a true Gryffindor), despite Voldemort attempting to destroy it, and then used it to behead the snake Nagini.[8]\n\nMinerva McGonagall was what was considered a Hatstall, meaning the Sorting Hat took over five minutes to decide where to put her. Hatstalls were very rare. The Sorting Hat considered sorting Minerva McGonagall into Ravenclaw before choosing Gryffindor. Later, she became a teacher at Hogwarts and head of her old house. It was her job to place the Sorting Hat on the heads of new students.[4]\n\nThe Sorting Hat considered Sorting Filius Flitwick into Gryffindor before choosing Ravenclaw. Later, he became a teacher at Hogwarts and head of his house, and joked with Minerva McGonagall about the fact that they had the opposite experiences and if things had gone another way, they could have had each others' jobs.[4]\n\nThe Sorting Hat considered Sorting Gilderoy Lockhart in Slytherin, but, in the end, decided to place him in Ravenclaw.[22]\n\nThe Sorting Hat needed more than five minutes to decide whether Peter Pettigrew should be Sorted into Slytherin or Gryffindor. He was, thus, a true Hatstall. It chose Gryffindor. This decision was considered a mistake by many, though the Sorting Hat itself never considered it a mistake afterwards.[4]\n\nThough it was a hat, the Sorting Hat was sentient and had its own personality.[2] At the beginning of every term, the hat sung a new song,[2] which Ron Weasley speculated it spent the rest of the year thinking up,[10] describing each of the four houses of Hogwarts.[2] Despite its use in the purposes of \"sorting,\" the Hat had been known to urge students to maintain a united front in the face of adversity and danger. Its songs could be used in warning of troubles to come, and ultimately the hat represented the unity of the four houses under the Hogwarts school.[11]\n\nThe hat also appeared to have a sense of humour and expansive memory (as in the cases of the Weasleys all being in Gryffindor, and the Malfoys all being in Slytherin).[2]\n\nThe Sorting Hat on Pottermore uses a set of question to determine the house of a user. The questions vary in style and do not necessarily have four answers (one for each house). There are 27 questions in all, and each user can be asked a maximum of 7, or 8 if the hat can not decide between houses and asks your opinion. Generally, a set of a few questions can be given to a user for each question, there are, of course, occasional exceptions to the order.",
