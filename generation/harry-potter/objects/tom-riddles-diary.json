  "content": "T. M. Riddle's Diary[6] was a simple blank diary belonging to Tom Riddle, who also transformed it into a Horcrux in 1943, during Riddle's fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It was the first Horcrux he ever made and was used as a weapon.[3]\n\nBefore Lord Voldemort's first defeat in 1981 the diary was passed to Death Eater Lucius Malfoy. In secret, Malfoy kept the diary before he slipped it, unnoticed, into Ginny Weasley's cauldron of school supplies at Flourish and Blotts in 1992.[7]\n\nThe diary used its dark magical influence to bewitch and force Ginny to re-open the Chamber of Secrets, but it was destroyed by Harry Potter in 1993 with a Basilisk's fang.[2] This diary served as proof that Lord Voldemort was indeed using Horcruxes.\n\nThis diary was originally purchased by Riddle in a Muggle shop called Winstanley's Bookstore & Stationers on Vauxhall Road in London, sometime before or during 1943.[1]\n\nWhen Tom Marvolo Riddle was in his fifth year at Hogwarts, he achieved his goal of locating Salazar Slytherin's Chamber of Secrets and used his ability to speak Parseltongue to open it. He further used this language ability to order the Chamber's Basilisk to terrorise the school and hunt down the Muggle-born students. Eventually one of the Muggle-borns, a Ravenclaw girl named Myrtle Warren, was killed by the Basilisk.[2] Riddle would later use this murder to infuse the journal with a piece of his soul, and transformed it into his first Horcrux.[3]\n\nAfter Myrtle's death, Albus Dumbledore, then Professor of Transfiguration, began suspecting Riddle. Knowing it was no longer safe to open the Chamber, and that the school might be shut down if the perpetrator was not caught, Riddle framed Rubeus Hagrid and his pet Acromantula Aragog for the crimes, and earned himself an award for Special Services to the school.[1] He imbued the diary with other powers, so that the Chamber could be opened again in the future.\n\nIn the following years, Riddle also questioned Potions Master, Horace Slughorn about the properties of a Horcrux and how one might create multiple ones. Influenced by Riddle's charisma and believing his own wisdom was being admired, Slughorn told Riddle what little he knew on the subject, though he expressed the worry that Riddle was intending to create Horcruxes rather than simply discuss them. Based from Slughorn's information, Riddle became positive on the possibility of creating more than one Horcrux, and became confident of using the diary as a weapon instead of the intended safeguard.[3]\n\nSome time during the First Wizarding War, Lord Voldemort entrusted the diary to Death Eater, Lucius Malfoy. The plan was to use the diary to reopen the Chamber, but Voldemort fell before that plan came to fruition, although Voldemort never told Lucius that the diary contained a fragment of his soul, instead simply making it appear to be cleverly charmed. In his weakened state, Voldemort had believed that Lucius would simply continue to safeguard the diary. However, the Dark Lord was relying too much on Malfoy's fear of him, but Malfoy believed him to be dead. Malfoy still possessed the diary and, in 1992, he planted it on Ginny Weasley, hoping to kill three birds with one stone by sabotaging Ginny's father, purge the school of Muggle-borns, and eliminate an incriminating Dark artefact.[4]\n\nBecause Lucius was unaware that the diary was actually a container for his master's soul fragment, he treated it with such light-handedness. When the Weasleys and Harry left to King's Cross Station, Ginny accidentally left the diary behind at the Burrow. Just before they got to the motorway, she remembered the diary and demanded to be allowed to go back and get it.[8] She soon learned how to use the diary to communicate with Tom Riddle, though she was unaware that he was Lord Voldemort, or if he was even real. Ginny wrote all of her deepest feelings and secrets in the diary, including her feelings of infatuation toward Harry Potter.\n\nHer emotional vulnerability allowed the fragment of Voldemort's soul within the diary to gain partial control of her mind. Once the diary had partial control of her he forced her to re-open the Chamber of Secrets. Ginny was forced not only to paint terrifying threats in the school corridors,[9] but she released the Basilisk within the Chamber as well. She also strangled the school roosters to protect the Basilisk, as the rooster's crowing is fatal to it.[10] She did all this while in a sort of trance, never knowing what she had done.\n\nThe Basilisk attacked several members of the Hogwarts community, including Mrs Norris, Colin Creevey, Justin Finch-Fletchley, Nearly-Headless Nick, Hermione Granger, and Penelope Clearwater. These individuals were not murdered by the Basilisk, but Petrified, due to them never seeing the Basilisk directly through a series of fortunate events, ranging from seeing a reflection to seeing it through a camera to the viewer being dead already.[9][11][10][12]\n\nWhen the attacks began, Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger began to investigate the matter. They initially suspected Draco Malfoy, who was openly prejudiced against Muggle-borns, but after using Polyjuice Potion to spy on him, they discovered that, other than him knowing that the Chamber of Secrets had previously been opened fifty years ago, he knew as little about the attacks as they did.[13]\n\nHermione eventually deduced that the monster had to be a Basilisk, due to Harry's ability to hear it and the nature of the attacks, but she was petrified before she could inform Harry or Ron, though she managed to leave them a relatively straightforward clue, a clipping from a Magizoology book Most Macabre Monstrosities.[12]\n\nHarry heard strange voices in the walls of Hogwarts, which exhorted the urge to kill.[14] Harry followed the voices through the Hogwarts corridors until he came upon the second floor girls' lavatory. It was here that he discovered the water-logged diary, which Ginny had discarded when she suspected that it was she who had petrified the Muggle-borns and finally realised that the diary was the cause.\n\nSoon enough, Harry was communicating with Tom Riddle, who showed him a memory within the diary, in which Riddle confronted Rubeus Hagrid about the keeping of a dangerous pet. This implied to Harry that Hagrid had opened the Chamber of Secrets, but Riddle was merely using Hagrid's pet Acromantula, Aragog, as a scapegoat so Hogwarts would not be closed down, and had in fact been using a monster that was infinitely more dangerous himself, showing that his actions (though done to eliminate suspicion) were also shallow hypocrisy.[1]\n\nLater, Ginny, having seen the diary amongst Harry's books, stole the diary from Harry's room in the Gryffindor Boys' Dormitory.[15] She feared that Riddle would tell Harry about her feelings toward him, and shortly thereafter went missing. She was forced to paint a threat against her life on the walls of a hallway and sealed herself inside the Chamber. Hogwarts was again under threat of being closed down.[12][2]\n\nOn the evening of 29 May 1993, Harry returned to the girls' lavatory and successfully discovered and opened the Chamber of Secrets. He, Ron, and Professor Gilderoy Lockhart made their way into the Chamber. Lockhart, who had no plans to actually fight the Basilisk, attacked the students with Ron's own broken wand, which backfired on him, and wiped his memory.\n\nHarry continued into the Chamber, where he discovered an unconscious Ginny next to Tom Riddle, who was gaining strength and form. Concealing his true nature as a Horcrux, Riddle claimed to be a memory of his younger self, and revealed the truth of his identity and plans to Harry and unleashed the Basilisk.[2]\n\nHarry slayed the Basilisk with the assistance of Dumbledore's phoenix, Fawkes and the Sword of Gryffindor, which appeared from the Sorting Hat. Harry stabbed the Basilisk through the roof of its mouth, but was bitten in the process. Harry then took one of the Basilisk's fangs and stabbed the diary with it. This successfully destroyed the Horcrux, as basilisk venom was ironically one of the few substances that could destroy it beyond magical repair. Before the diary was destroyed, Fawkes mended Harry's arm with his tears. This healed him instantly, saving his life.\n\nWhen he later explained about the diary's true nature to Dumbledore, the latter was privately concerned, as no mere memory could just possess a girl and eventually take physical form,[2] and he suspected the diary was a Horcrux. Because of how careless this Horcrux was treated (after all, its purpose was to keep its owner immortal), Dumbledore theorised that Riddle had created more Horcruxes, something that had never been done before.[3]\n\nLord Voldemort was unaware that this Horcrux had been destroyed, until he forced the truth out of Lucius Malfoy (who did not know the diary was a Horcrux) shortly after his return to power in June of 1995, due to the portion of the soul being separated from his body for such a long time.\n\nDespite the known risks of using the diary as a weapon instead of a safeguard, Voldemort was nevertheless furious to learn of its destruction,[16] due to Lucius implementing the plan without Voldemort's say-so in order to dispose of the diary for his own benefit while also attempting to destroy the Weasley family and Dumbledore's reputation, as well as getting rid of an incriminating Dark Arts artefact (the Ministry was conducting a search at the time); this was one of the many reasons that he lost trust in the Malfoy family and why Lucius was punished and demoted.\n\nAlthough Voldemort was unaware of the diary's destruction until Malfoy reported it to him, he attributed this to his non-corporeal status at the time of its loss; as a result, he took no additional precautions to safeguard the remaining Horcruxes, and assumed that they were safe and undamaged until the break-in to Gringotts confirmed to him that Harry was hunting them.[17]\n\nAs a Horcrux, the diary allowed a writer to communicate with the memory of the sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle, merely through writing on the journal's blank pages.[1][2] The diary could transport the reader into a realm of memories, much like the Pensieve.[1] The diary was also able to siphon the life force from a reader and transfer it to Riddle's stored memory. This act was an endeavour to create a physical body for the sixteen-year-old Soul of Tom Riddle.\n\nThe closer a writer became to the memory of Tom Riddle emotionally, the more power the diary would acquire over him or her. For example, Ginny poured her fears and desires into the diary, thus making it easy for Tom to possess her. As this diary contained Riddle's soul, it also housed his magical powers. This included his ability to speak Parseltongue. He could even cause the diary writer to speak it while possessing them, which was instrumental in reopening the Chamber of Secrets.[2]\n\nIt was unclear whether other Horcruxes include any of these same abilities; however, Salazar Slytherin's Locket had a negative physical and emotional effect on those who wore it,[18] and Marvolo Gaunt's Ring fatally cursed Albus Dumbledore.[3] Also, it was unknown if Riddle had placed powerful enchantments to protect the diary from being destroyed by conventional means, as he did with all of his other Horcruxes, but it was highly likely that this was indeed the case. Ginny Weasley tried to flush it down the toilet, but it came back perfect as new.[1][2] When Harry's ink bottles shattered and drenched all of his other textbooks, the diary alone remained dry and unmarked.[1]",
