  "content": "The Firebolt was a world-class broomstick. It was the fastest at the time of its production, and was released in 1993. In time, the Firebolt broomstick was used by the Bulgarian and Irish National Quidditch teams. The teams played on Firebolts during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.\n\nBy 2014, the Firebolt had been superseded by the Firebolt Supreme, apparently manufactured by the same makers.[2]\n\nThe Firebolt was a costly broom and Harry Potter was one of the first to own one. It continued to be made in relatively small quantities, partly because the goblin workers involved in the patented ironwork were prone to strikes and walkouts at the smallest provocation.\n\nThe Firebolt was capable of going from nought to one hundred and fifty miles per hour in ten seconds. This broomstick also boasted an unbreakable Slowing Charm, superb balance and precision, and hovered at reasonable mounting height when let go. By 1994, the Firebolt was the fastest broomstick in the whole world.[3]\n\nThe handle was made of polished ebony (once mistakenly listed as ash in a Quality Quidditch Supplies advertisement), and the twigs could be made of either birch or hazel depending on customer preference. Birch twigs offered more \"oomph\" when ascending, while hazel provided more precision in turning. The metal parts of the broom were goblin-made ironwork, a first for a broomstick, which increased stability and power in adverse conditions and prevented slippage on the foot grips.[1]\n\nEvery Firebolt included a golden registration number.[4]\n\nEven though the competitor Thunderbolt VII could attain speeds that rivalled that of the Firebolt series, many experts felt that it had sacrificed safety for speed — indeed, during the 2014 Quidditch World Cup, even though professional broomsticks were supposed to withstand all Bludger hits, the tail of Nigerian Seeker Samuel Equiano's Thunderbolt was smashed off by a Bludger shot hit by Japanese Beater Masaki Hongo.[5]\n\nThe Firebolt was first developed by Randolph Spudmore around 1993, at a time when brooms made by the Nimbus Racing Broom Company dominated the market. Twelve months after its release, the Firebolt was the highest-selling racing broom of that time, beating out the Nimbus 2000 and 2001.[1]\n\nThe Firebolt was used by both the Irish and Bulgarian teams during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.[6]\n\nHarry Potter first saw a prototype Firebolt broom in the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies in the summer before his third year. He wanted one, but he already had a Nimbus 2000 and had to remind himself of that to keep himself from going in and asking what the price was. It was said that he would have to empty his vault in Gringotts, should he actually purchase the Firebolt.\n\nEvery day that he was in Diagon Alley, before his third year at Hogwarts, he made sure that he passed the window so that he could stare in awe at the amazing and magnificent broom. He received a Firebolt as an anonymous present from his godfather, Sirius Black at Christmas 1993, after his Nimbus 2000 was destroyed by the Whomping Willow during a Quidditch match against Hufflepuff team. Miniature models were also produced as gifts.[7] In 1995, Harry's Firebolt was confiscated by Dolores Umbridge as punishment.\n\nUmbridge kept it in her office until Fred and George Weasley destroyed her office door during their exit from Hogwarts. It was then said to have been taken to one of the Dungeons where it was guarded by a Security troll at all times. Harry presumably was given back his Firebolt after Umbridge was fired. Harry was the only person in Hogwarts that owned a Firebolt, until losing it in the Battle of the Seven Potters.[8]\n\nFirebolts continued to be made in small quantities in the modern day, though their development was hindered by frequent strikes and walkouts on the part of the goblins who manufactured the iron parts.[1]",
