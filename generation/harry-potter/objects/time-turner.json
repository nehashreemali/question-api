  "content": "A Time-Turner was a magical device used for time travel. It was a special timepiece which resembled an hourglass on a necklace.[1][3]\n\nThe British Ministry of Magic encased an Hour-Reversal Charm in the time turners they created, for additional stability. The number of times one turned the hourglass corresponded to the number of hours one travelled back in time. However, they could only stay in the past for five hours at a time, without the possibility of serious harm to the traveller or to time itself.[1]\n\nHowever, by 2020, two other \"true\" kind of time-turners were created. The prototype only let the time traveller stay in the past for five minutes, while the improved model let them to stay in the past for as long as they wanted, and return to the future when they wanted.[5]\n\nHermione Granger received one from Professor McGonagall in 1993, so that she could attend more classes in her third year than time would allow. Since McGonagall made her swear to not tell anyone about it, she did not mention it to Harry Potter or Ron Weasley until the end of the school year, when she and Harry used it to travel back in time and save Sirius Black and Buckbeak from certain death. Special permission from the Ministry of Magic had to be sought to allow Hermione to use one, but her academic record ensured that permission was given.[3]\n\nHermione found her third year stressful with the extra class load, and therefore decided to drop Divination, which she despised, and Muggle Studies, which she did not find very useful, given that she was a Muggle-born. This allowed her to have a normal schedule once again, and she returned her Time-Turner. Ron was disappointed that Hermione did not tell her friends about it, despite her promise to McGonagall.[7]\n\nThe entire stock of Time-Turners, located in the Time Room, in the Ministry of Magic were rendered useless during the Battle of the Department of Mysteries in 1996. While not \"destroyed\" per se, due to the way one of them fell when their counter was knocked over, the entire stock was trapped in an endless loop of falling over, un-falling, and then re-falling, in an endless cycle for all eternity, and was thus unable to be used.[2][8]\n\nWhen Dolores Umbridge escaped from custody during her trial, she allied herself with a small group of remnant Death Eaters in an attempt to use a Time-Turner to save Lord Voldemort from his defeat and restore his despotic rule, leading up to the Battle at the Ministry, where they were stopped by the trio.[9] This may mean that the Ministry has successfully stopped the endless cycle of the Time-Turners' destruction and repair, or new ones were created as replacement. Regardless, her plan failed, as during the battle, the Time Room was blown apart, and all the Time-Turners were destroyed.[9]\n\nBy August 2020, Theodore Nott, while working for Lucius Malfoy, created a prototype of a time-turner, presumably in the hope of saving Voldemort from his fate. The prototype only let the time-traveller stay in the past for five minutes, although they could travel as far back as they wanted.[5]\n\nNott eventually created a better and improved model, which let the time-traveller stay in the past for as long as they wanted. They could also use the device to return to the future when needed. While Malfoy kept the improved model, which was eventually passed down to his son, Nott kept the prototype. Even though they both owned something which could be used to save Voldemort, neither of them tried.[5]\n\nIn August 2020, Harry Potter, in his capacity as the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, retrieved the previously unknown Time-Turner at the home of Nott. Being a \"true\" Time-Turner, it had the potential to cause catastrophic effects on time, and Nott was arrested for creating such a dangerous device.[5]\n\nAlthough it was hidden in the office of Minister for Magic Hermione Granger, it was later stolen by Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy, who intended to use it in order to save Cedric Diggory and return him to his father. They created a disastrous sequence of events and alternate realities, finding that they could only stay in the past for five minutes. They managed to correct events and set time right with the help of the alternate Hermione, Ron Weasley, and Severus Snape.[5]\n\nWhen they were were abducted by Delphini, she used the time-turner to travel back to October 1981 to save her father. She then destroyed it to ensure she would not be forced to return to the present via the five minute restriction.[5]\n\nHowever, in the present, Draco Malfoy revealed he had the improved Time-Turner from his father that would allow him to stay in the past for as long as he wanted; he had always had to resist the urge to use it to see his deceased wife one more time. Along with Harry, Ron, Ginny and Hermione, they travelled back in time with help from a message sent by Albus in the past. They stopped Delphini by the combined might of both generations, and then returned to the future.[10]\n\nTime-Turners that were issued by the Ministry of Magic have an Hour-Reversal Charm placed onto them. The Charm placed on them was unstable on its own and benefited from a container.[1] Unlike the Time-Turners created by Theodore Nott, these Ministry-approved ones were not known to be able to travel forward in time (i.e. return to the time they started from).\n\nThe Ministry had a limited quantity which were not easily replaceable.[1] During the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, the Ministry's entire stockpile were destroyed and they were not repaired nor replaced.[2] Hogwarts students can apply for such a Time-Turner in order to take more classes, but they must undergo a large amount of screening process and must follow the most stringent set of rules, such as not abusing its powers nor let any outsiders know about it.[3]\n\nA pair of Time-Turners were created by Theodore Nott while he was working for Lucius Malfoy. There were two in total, and they were not restricted by an Hour-Reversal Charm, allowing one to travel back years or even decades. The prototype was kept by Nott until the Ministry found it following his arrest by Harry Potter. It was made of inexpensive metal and was not the finalised version; although still far more powerful than any Time Turner that had preceded it, the user could only stay in the past for five minutes before being sent back to the present.[5]\n\nHowever, Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy retrieved it and proved (albeit unintentionally) that a person could create enough damage with catastrophic results in such a small window. When Delphi took it, she destroyed it while still in the past and proved that the device would then allow the users to stay in the past indefinitely.[5]\n\nNott was arrested when he was found to have created and being in possession of such a dangerous device. When Albus and Scorpius were found using this device, they were very close to being expelled by Headmistress Minerva McGonagall had she not been understanding enough from her experience with their parents. Nevertheless, she barred them from all future visits to Hogsmeade, cancelled all their Christmas and Easter holidays, and gave them a multitude of detentions while their parents gave them a severe scolding. Delphi was later arrested for using the device in an attempt to alter the timeline illegally, along with the cold-blooded murder of Craig Bowker Jnr with the Killing Curse.[5]\n\nLucius kept the second \"true\" Time-Turner, as he enjoyed collecting powerful artefacts. The finalised device gleamed like gold and was not restrained by a five-minute duration. By his son Draco Malfoy's belief, Lucius originally commissioned the creation of the Time-Turner to save Lord Voldemort from his fate but ultimately decided not to. He passed the Time-Turner down to Draco, who used it to save Albus and Scorpius by travelling to the past. The device allowed them to return to the future by their own choice instead of waiting for five minutes. Harry Potter told him that had the Ministry found Draco with the dangerous device, he would be sent to Azkaban for it.[5]\n\nTime-related magic was unstable, and serious breaches in the laws of time resulted in catastrophic events.[1] According to Professor Saul Croaker: 'Just as the human mind cannot comprehend time, so it cannot comprehend the damage that will ensue if we presume to tamper with its laws'. Possible scenarios include a wizard or witch killing their past or future selves by mistake,[3] or altering one's life path in such a drastic fashion that it could result in temporal anomalies such as un-births,[5] making it imperative for users to practise discretion and operate in secret lest they encounter their past selves and do irreparable harm.[3] While not as potentially dangerous as skipping five centuries, even the re-use of a single hour could still have dramatic consequences and the Ministry of Magic enforced the strictest guarantees if it permitted the use of these rare and powerful objects. Time-Turner possession was hedged around with literally hundreds of laws, and the most stringent laws and penalties were in place to prevent their misuse. It would have surprised most of the magical community to know that Time-Turners were generally only used to solve the most trivial problems of time management and never for greater or more important purposes.[1][5]\n\nThe consequences of meddling with time could be as severe as creating an alternate timeline, such as one in which Lord Voldemort was never defeated and still ruled. In this case, however, the person who had used the Time-Turner, if they still existed and weren't un-born, would still have memory of the events of the original, un-corrupted timeline, but would have to learn second-hand the nature of the changes which had been made.[5] The alternate timeline apparently disappeared when the changes were \"fixed\". Another consequence of travelling long distances through time was that time itself could have been disturbed by such a serious breach of its laws. Such was the case after Eloise Mintumble returned from her five-century trip. The Tuesday following her reappearance lasted two and a half full days, whereas the Thursday shot by in the space of four hours. The Ministry of Magic had a great deal of trouble in covering this up.[1]\n\nAccording to Professor Croaker's law, the longest period that could be travelled back in time without serious chance of harm to the traveller or time itself was around five hours.[1][11]",
