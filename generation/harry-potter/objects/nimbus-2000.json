  "content": "The Nimbus 2000 was a broomstick produced by the Nimbus Racing Broom Company as part of their successful line of racing brooms. At the time of its release in 1991, it was the fastest broomstick in production.[1] The Nimbus 2000 easily outperformed its competitors on the Quidditch pitch until it was replaced as the top broomstick by the Nimbus 2001.[2]\n\nThe broom was released in or before August 1991 and became the best broom on offer at the time. It was very popular but expensive to purchase.[3] The broom handle was made of mahogany, and appeared sleek and shiny. It had a long tail of neat twigs with the words \"Nimbus Two Thousand\" written in gold near the top of the handle.[3] It was also light and speedy.[4] It has protections against tampering that can only be subverted by powerful Dark Magic.[1]\n\nThe Japanese National Quidditch team rode on Nimbus 2000s during the 1994 Quidditch World Cup.[5]\n\nHarry Potter received one from Minerva McGonagall when he joined the Gryffindor Quidditch team as the new Seeker.[3] He owned it for two years until the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff Quidditch match in November 1993.\nHarry fell off the broom when dementors appeared on the pitch, and it struck the Whomping Willow. Later, when Harry asked about his broomstick, Ron uncovered the damaged remains in the Hospital Wing, the broom having been reduced to splinters.[6]\n\n\"Nimbus\" means \"rainstorm\" or \"cloud\" in Latin. This is probably a reference to its flying.",
