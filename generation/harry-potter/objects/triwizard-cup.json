  "content": "The Triwizard Cup was a shining cup that was awarded to the winner of a Triwizard Tournament, and held as an honour by the victorious school until the next tournament.[1]\n\nThe Cup was made no later than 1294, the date when the earliest known Triwizard Tournament took place. Ever since its creation, the Cup has been held by the victorious school until the next Tournament took place.[1]\n\nDuring the 1792 Triwizard Tournament, the tournament was won by Hogwarts. As the tournament was discontinued for over two hundred years after that, Hogwarts held onto the cup for a long time, which they stored in the Trophy Room.[3]\n\nIn the 1994-1995 Triwizard Tournament, the Cup was turned into a Portkey by Barty Crouch Jnr (while impersonating Alastor Moody) that would transport the winner to the graveyard where Tom Riddle's father was buried and Lord Voldemort was waiting.[4]\n\nHarry Potter and Cedric Diggory then touched the Portkey both at the same time having not decided on who should take it, and they both appeared at the graveyard.[2][5] Harry then used it to escape back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with Diggory's body after the duel in the graveyard in Little Hangleton.[6] The fate of the Cup afterwards is unknown, but it has not been awarded since as the Triwizard Tournament was discontinued.[7][8]\n\nIn the 2010s, the Triwizard Cup was one of the various magical artefacts from the Wizarding world that became caught up in the Calamity.[9]",
