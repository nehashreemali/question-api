  "content": "A wand was a quasi-sentient magical instrument through which a witch or wizard channelled their magical powers to centralise the effects for more complex results.[3] Most spells were cast with the aid of wands, but spells could be cast without the use of wands. Although wandless magic was more common in other countries, such as some in Africa, European wizards were generally used to using the tool and found wandless magic more difficult, requiring much more concentration and skill to perform these spells. Additionally, it was possible for a wand casting a constant effect such as the Sunlight Charm to be removed from the caster's hand and continue to produce the charm.[4]\n\nSome magical creatures such as house-elves and goblins were known to perform magic similar to that used by wizards and, in fact, were forbidden to carry wands. This had been a point of contention between wizards and goblins for centuries.[5]\n\nWands were manufactured and sold by wandmakers, the most famous of these in Great Britain being Garrick Ollivander, and in Eastern Europe, Mykew Gregorovitch. Each wand consisted of a specific type of wood that surrounded a core of magical substance. Although the wand cores might came from the same creature, or the wood might came from the same tree, no two existing wands were exactly alike. The study of the history and the magical properties of wands was called wandlore.[6] Wands were often buried alongside their owners or burned when their owner died, though there were several instances of wands being passed down through families or otherwise finding their way into the black market of the Wizarding community.[7]\n\nWands were developed in Europe[8][9] at an unknown point, though it was known that it was in the B.C. era. The Ollivander family started manufacturing wands in 382 B.C.[10] Over time, they earned a worldwide reputation.[11] In the 13th century, the Elder Wand, which would become known as the most powerful wand in existence, was created.\n\nThe first witch who was a wandmaker in North America was Irish witch Isolt Sayre,[12] who came to North America and started making wands for her adoptive sons and the students of her school Ilvermorny with her husband James Steward. With the passage of Rappaport's Law, no child was allowed a wand until they arrived at Ilvermorny, and they had to leave them there during the holidays until they reached the age of seventeen.[13] By the 1920s, the use of wands had become common in North America although every witch and wizard, including tourists, needed a Wand permit.[9]\n\nAt an unknown point in history, wands were introduced to Asia. Cherry wand masters received special prestige at Mahoutokoro school in Japan.[14]\n\nIn the 20th century, wands were introduced to Africa, where they were less commonly used compared to other parts of the world.[8]\n\nOllivanders in Diagon Alley had changed the way that wands were created. Before Garrick Ollivander's practice of using only the three \"Supreme Cores\", it was common for witches and wizards to present a wandmaker with a magical substance to which they had a particular attachment for use as a wand core.[15] After Garrick watched his father, Gervaise Ollivander, struggle with substandard wand cores (Kneazle whiskers, Dittany stalks, and kelpie manes), he decided to devote his time to studying the properties of wand cores so that he could utilise only the finest.[16]\n\nThere was at least one known business that specialised in tuning wands to improve their performance. Repair services were also available, as were waxing and cleaning services. Wand polishing machines were located in the Woolworth Building, and in the 19th century a wand cleaning company placed advertisements in the Daily Prophet for their services.[17]\n\nWands were referred to as \"quasi-sentient\" because their being imbued with a great deal of magic made them as animate as an inanimate object could be.[18] Although they could not think or communicate like a human, they could perform certain actions through their own will. This ability may have been how they chose their wizard or witch and also explains Harry's wand autonomously acting against Voldemort.[19] They could perform actions such as picking their owners, changing allegiances, and, in certain circumstances, perform magic on their own.\n\nEvery single wand was unique and its character would depend on the particular tree and magical creature which its materials were derived from. Moreover, each wand, from the moment it found its ideal owner, would begin to learn from and teach its human partner. Salazar Slytherin taught his wand to sleep unless a command in Parseltongue was given.\n\nMagic with a wand was usually performed with an incantation, but more experienced wizards could cast nonverbal spells, which concealed the spell until cast and could thereby prevent an opponent from adequately protecting themself in time.\n\nIn addition, wands possessed the capability to function underwater, although the appearance of spells would change, as was demonstrated when Harry Potter attempted to use a Revulsion Jinx to free himself from the grip of several Grindylows. Harry noted that instead of \"sending sparks at the Grindylows\", it \"pelted them with what seemed to be a jet of boiling water\".[20]\n\nNotably, some witches and wizards were able to sense their own wand if it was close by, even if they themselves were not holding it.[21]\n\nWands had an unfortunate tendency of rebelling and backfiring when handled by Muggles, most notably in the incident which lead to the creation of Rappaport's Law.[22]\n\nA record of all the spells a wand had used could be checked using the Reverse Spell (Prior Incantato). This was a prime reason why criminals who wished to act discreetly would not use their own wands to perform illegal spells, fearing this record would betray them; instead, they could borrow someone else's wand to act with impunity, letting the other owner take the fall.[20][5] The record seemed to be rather intricate, as Peter Pettigrew took Voldemort's wand in fear it might reveal his treason, suggesting the wand had such records (such as branding the Dark Mark onto Pettigrew himself).[23]\n\nIf two wands had twin cores — meaning that their cores came from the same magical creature, two feathers from the same Phoenix for example -  then those wands were referred to as \"brothers\", and they could not be forced to duel against one another. Should two such wands ever come in the way of one another, a rare connection was formed called Priori Incantatem. When the connection was formed, the wands battled to merge a golden orb into the other's shaft; the one that succeeded to force the orb into the other was the winning wand. The losing wand would then produce \"echoes\" of the most recent spells it had been used to perform in reverse order. Because of its rarity, most wizards never learned that such a connection was possible - this was the first law of Priori Incantatem.[24]\n\nAfter two brother wands connected through means of Priori Incantatem, both wands came to know one another and might react towards each other without the consent of their owners, or the winning wand only reacted towards the losing wand - this was the second law of Priori Incantatem.[24] Also, under special conditions, it was possible for one wand to recognise its \"brother's\" master, even when its \"brother's\" master used different wand. For example, during the Battle of the Seven Potters, Harry's wand recognised Voldemort and spurted \"golden flames\" at him, even though Voldemort was using Lucius Malfoy's wand at the time. Furthermore, Lucius's wand was destroyed as result.[19]\n\nAlternatively, if two wands with the same core were used alongside each other, their combined magical power would increase significantly to the benefit of their owners. When Chadwick and Webster Boot used their wands, which both had cores from the same Horned Serpent, as a team, it increased their power tenfold.[13]\n\nWandlore was a specific class of magic that referred to the history and magical properties of wands. Mr Ollivander claimed that it was a \"complex and mysterious branch of magic\" and even the most skilled did not fully comprehend it.[6]\n\nThe idea that a wand chose the wizard and could switch allegiance, as believed by Ollivander, was a part of wandlore. However, Cosme Acajor believed that while the wand had an impact in choosing the wizard, the wizard chose the wand too, not just the other way around.\n\nWands possessed a force of magic that itself had its own boundaries where none could go beyond. This was similar to Newton's laws of motion and other forces, and were known as the subtle laws of wands.[6]\n\nThe first and most prominent rule that governed wandlore was that the wand chose the wizard whom it would work for, not the other way around.[25] Though wands were unthinking objects, they had the ability to judge the person who held them and determine if that wizard was a compatible match and had a sense of loyalty towards their rightful owners. A wand choosing to work for a wizard was said to have given them its allegiance.\n\nThe second rule stated that the connections made between wizard and wand were complex, and that they would grow with experience over time, the wand learning from the wizard, and the wizard from the wand.\n\nThird, a wizard might channel his energy with any wand, whether his own or a different wand entirely. However, the best results came where there was a great likeness between a wizard and a wand. When a wand had chosen its holder (e.g. when the holder had truly mastered that wand), they could be assured the best results with it.[6]\n\nThis bond between wizard and wand seemed to go both ways; if the bond was severed and the wand's loyalty changed to a new master, then a witch or wizard would have been better served to acquire a new wand rather than continue using it, because it would no longer perform at its peak for them. However, witches and wizards rarely wanted to part with their wands; during the Meeting at Malfoy Manor in 1997, Voldemort asked to borrow a wand from one of his followers, but none of them volunteered, as if he had asked them to give up one of their arms. Not even his most fanatical follower, Bellatrix Lestrange, offered her wand to him.[26]\n\nNotably, when Voldemort tried to kill Harry Potter with the Elder Wand, as well as when he tried to torture Harry with the Cruciatus Curse, his attempts failed and Harry went completely unharmed. This was because through a series of previous events, Harry had become master of the Elder Wand, and in the hands of another wizard, it could not be used to inflict harm on its rightful master to whom it was loyal. It is unknown if this rule applied to all wands or if the Elder Wand was a unique case.[27][28]\n\nSince wands had a sense of loyalty, they did not perform at their best for anyone other than their rightful master, but that also meant their loyalty could change from one master to another, so another way one could procure a wand was by \"winning\" it from its master. To win a wand, one must overpower and hence defeat its current master in some way. When a wand's master was disarmed, stunned, or killed, the wand might accept the old master's attacker as its new master. This was especially likely to happen with dragon heartstring wands.\n\nIt was always possible to simply steal or borrow another witch or wizard's wand, and the results would be fair, but its allegiance, and by extension its full power, would only bend towards the new master when it was actually won.[6] The allegiance of a wand that had not been won might have been noticeable to its holder, as Hermione Granger was uncomfortable using Bellatrix Lestrange's wand.[29]\n\nHowever, it should be noted that wands usually stayed loyal to their original owners. Most wands were attached to their masters and would not easily discontinue their allegiance, if at all. For example, even if a wizard was disarmed or lost a fight while carrying his wand, the wand would have developed an affinity with its original owner so that it would not be given up easily. Therefore, simply disarming a wizard might not be enough to win over a wand's allegiance. Furthermore, wands forcibly taken in circumstances of purely competitive or friendly nature, such as in practice duels, would not be won, as the perceived levity of the situation would prevent the wand from abandoning its defeated master. Additionally, wands stolen without attacking the previous master would not change allegiance.[30]\n\nEven when won, wands would often still retain some fealty to the original owner, as they bonded most strongly with their original owners.[31] The only exception to this rule was the Elder Wand, which was \"completely unsentimental\" and would only be loyal to strength. In other words, when won, it switched its allegiance entirely.[32] Additionally, the Elder Wand would transfer its allegiance even if its defeated master was not in possession of it at the time of their defeat. No other wand was known to share this trait. The Elder Wand's alliegence could be won as simply as by forcibly taking it from its current master's hand, as Harry Potter did with Draco Malfoy, although it was more frequentely obtained by murder.[28]\n\nNotably, if a wands loyalty changed from one wizard to another while the first wizard had a spell already in effect, the spell would not be undone when the wands loyalty changed. During the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Albus Dumbledore used the Full Body-Bind Curse to immobilise Harry Potter, and even after Draco Malfoy disarmed Dumbledore and his wands loyalty changed to him, Harry remained immobilised. However, the wand in question was the Elder Wand, so it's unknown if special rules applied.[33]\n\nWands chose the wizard or witch in a way that was neither random, nor serendipitous.[25][6] There was much ancient mythology and botanical knowledge regarding the powers and natures of wood and other natural elements.\n\nThrough wandlore, a future wandmaker could learn the ancient secrets of creating a wand, each one having four components: wood, core, length, and flexibility. However, no single aspect of wand composition should be considered in isolation of all the others, nor should the owner's life experience and style of magic, all of which would combine to make the wand in question totally unique. The type of wood, the core, the length, and the flexibility of the wand may either counterbalance or enhance the attributes of each other.\n\nIn almost all documented cases, the wand chose the wizard who matched its character because the wizard might have difficulty or be unable to perform magic if his or her wand's character conflicted, or the magic might be sub-par to magic performed with a matching wand.\n\nJust as a minority of humans could produce magic, only a minority of trees could produce wood that was \"wand quality\". It took years of experience for a wandmaker to be able to identify these trees, although a good way to tell the difference was to search for Bowtruckles nesting in the leaves, as they never inhabited mundane trees.\n\nDifferent types of wood had their own \"personalities\" and thus wands were likely to choose a wizard with a matching personality. Every single wand was unique and its character would depend on the particular tree and magical creature from which its materials were derived. Ollivander believed that wand wood had almost human powers of perception and preferences.[3]\n\nSome wand woods were better suited for certain branches of magic. Fir wands were particularly good for transfiguration, yew wands were especially fearsome in the fields of duelling and curses, and alder wands worked better than any other wand wood with nonverbal spells. On the other hand, some woods were poorly suited for certain branches of magic. Acacia wands had a subtle nature and were not suited for \"bangs-and-smells magic\", and apple wood mixed poorly with the Dark Arts. Additionally, some woods reacted to certain wand cores in unique ways, altering the wands character and/or magical potential.\n\nWand-making was the study of a lifetime, and wandmakers could continue to learn with every wand they made and matched.[3] Moreover, each wand, from the moment it found its ideal owner, would begin to learn from and teach its human partner. Therefore, the following notes on various known wand woods should be regarded as general notes to use as a starting point, and ought not to be taken to describe any individual wand.[3]\n\nNote: The wand woods Mahogany, Rosewood, Snakewood, Sugar Maple, and Tamarack possessed unknown properties and magical affinities.\n\nThe core of a wand was a magical substance placed within the length of wood, usually extracted from a magical creature.[15][25] These magical cores enhanced the wand's magic or gave the wand wood magical abilities. Without it, a wand would have just been a piece of wood, even if it came from a wand quality tree, effectively making it a fake wand. The only cores able to produce magic were from a magical species.\n\nThere were many different possible materials that could be used as wand cores, including Veela hair, Thestral tail hair, Troll whiskers, and Basilisk horns, among other materials. Different wand cores had different magical properties. The hair of a Unicorn was not very strong, but it was stable and reliable, whereas dragon heartstring was very strong and flamboyant, but more prone to accidents. Additionally, wand cores were known to reflect the nature of the source they came from; since a phoenix was one of the most detached and independent creatures in the world, a phoenix feather wand was incredibly picky when choosing a potential wielder, and unicorn hair wands were incredibly difficult to turn to the Dark Arts due to unicorns' purity. Mr Ollivander opted to only use phoenix feathers, unicorn hairs, and dragon heartstrings, which he believed might be the best and most powerful of magical cores. He was likely correct about these three Supreme Cores as Ollivander's wands had been praised by many witches and wizards from around the world.[39]\n\nInterestingly, certain wand woods reacted with certain cores in unique ways, affecting the wand's personality and/or magical abilities. Holly and phoenix feather were a difficult combination due to their opposite natures, but when such a wand found its perfect match, nothing and nobody should stand in their way. A cherry wand with dragon heartstring was ill-advised to be paired with a wizard who lacked exceptional self-control and strength of mind. A wand of ash was wholly loyal to its one true original master and would lose power and skill if passed to someone else, especially if it had a unicorn hair core.\n\nThe core type was also known to influence the temperament of the wand produced with it. For example, the wand-maker Garrick Ollivander would not use Veela hair for cores because he believed they made for \"temperamental\" wands.[39] Thestral tail hair was also an interesting core — the wand couldn't simply be mastered by winning them. It could only be mastered by a witch or wizard who was able to face death, which was why Voldemort struggled to master the Elder Wand.[40]\n\nJust as with the different types of wood, all of the wands attributes, as well as the characteristics and experiences of the owner, might have counterbalanced or outweighed each other. Therefore, the following notes could only be taken as a general starting point.\n\nAll wands had their individual lengths, usually between 9 and 14 inches. However shorter wands (8 inches and under) and longer wands (15 inches and greater) did exist, though they were exceptionally rare. In the latter case, a physical peculiarity may have demanded the excessive wand length. Alternatively, many small witches and wizards are chosen by longer wands.\n\nLonger wands tended to suit those with big personalities, of a more spacious and dramatic style of magic. Neater wands favoured elegant and refined spell-casting. Particularly short wands would choose wizards whose character lacked something.[45] This was exemplified by the extreme length of Hagrid's wand, being attributable to his excitable, outgoing, and energetic personality, while Umbridge, who had an \"unusually short\" and stubby wand, was known for her extreme bigotry and lacked empathy and was very cruel, yet stuck to politics and never sought power greater than what the law could grant her.[46]\n\nThere might also be some correlation between a person's size and the lengths of their wands. Rubeus Hagrid, who was half-giant, owned one of the longest known wand; it was sixteen inches long and made of oak. The shortest known wand once belonged to Dolores Umbridge, who was described as being squat and toad-like. Many wandmakers simply matched the wand length to the size of the witch or wizard who would use it, however, according to Garrick Ollivander, matching a wand to a wizard solely by height was a crude measure and failed to take into account many other important considerations.[46]\n\nUsually, wands were only described in terms of the source tree, its core, and its length. However, occasionally, the firmness of the wand wood had also been described. The rigidity or flexibility of a wand characterised the willingness to change and adapt of the wand-and-wizard pair.[45][46]\n\nFor example, the wand of Harry Potter was described as \"nice and supple\", the wand of Bellatrix Lestrange was \"unyielding\", the wand of Draco Malfoy was \"reasonably springy\", and the wand of Rubeus Hagrid was \"rather bendy\".\n\nIf a wand had suffered an immense degree of damage, either from an enemy spell or by a physical strike, it could not be fixed by any means most wandmakers knew of. Spellotape, among other methods, could have been used to put the pieces back together, but its magical capabilities would have still been damaged beyond repair. The wand would subsequently start to malfunction, resulting in spells going wrong or backfiring on the wizard. There was also a chance the wand might break again while performing magic.[47]\n\nNotably, any student expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry prior to graduation, then their wand would have been broken and they would be prohibited from using magic anymore. Although, successfully completing the O.W.L. exams was taken a sign that the student in question was trustworthy enough to be a law-abiding citizen who could learn from their mistakes. Thus, any such students who were expelled would be permitted to keep their wands and could continue to practise magic.\n\nThe only thing known to be capable of fixing a broken wand was the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in the entire world. This was seen when Harry Potter's wand was broken from a reflected Blasting Curse and Hermione Granger was unable to repair it;[48] Harry, however, fixed it with the aid of the Elder Wand.[49] Although, this ability might be lost if the current master died undefeated, because most of the wand's power would disappear with them.\n\n\"Wilting\" of a wand, also known as the wand \"dying\", was an occurrence in which the wand expelled all magic, inhibiting its further magical use. It usually happened following some kind of stress in the relationship between the wand and its owner. Unicorn hair wands in particular were especially prone to melancholy if mishandled.\n\nThis phenomenon most often occurred with hazel wands, which often bonded so strongly with their true masters that after their owners' death, those wands lost all magic in this way. Sycamore wands would wilt if allowed to become \"bored\" by continuous use of monotonous magic, such as fetching a pair of slippers. In this case, wilting was accompanied by the wand bursting into flame of its own volition. It was also possible that wands might \"die of shame\" by not conforming to the use their master was giving them.[50]\n\nIn the unique case of Salazar Slytherin's wand, it was commanded to wilt by Gormlaith Gaunt to prevent it from being used against her. She was able to do this due to the unique composition of the wand, and her gift of Parseltongue.[51]\n\nThis phenomenon was curable by replacing the wand core, unless the core was originally of unicorn hair, in which case there was no hope and the wand would have actually \"died\" as opposed to simply wilted.[52]\n\nIdeally, a witch or wizard's first wand would be a newly created one that has never had an owner before, obtained through purchase from an established wandmaker, such as Ollivanders. There existed competing theories as to how to choose the best wand. Garrick Ollivander, arguably one of the most famous wandmakers of the 20th century, argued that 'the wand chooses the wizard', and would have potential customers try a large selection of wands until one 'chose' them.[6] However, Cosme Acajor, France's most successful wandmaker, argued the opposite, that wizards chose the wand. He would have potential customers pick out the wand they wanted from a selection of available wands. Cosme's beliefs may have stemmed from the fact that his wand 'chose' him, but didn't work well for him until he modified it to suit his tastes.[53] Some people would also acquire their first wand through the act of making a wand, though typically people who made wands already owned a wand when they made another one. Notably, ancient celtic druids often made their first wand.[34]\n\nIn some families, a wands might be inherited, either out of sentimentality or because of a tight financial situation, such as Neville Longbottom using his father's wand and Ron Weasley using his brother Charlie's old wand. While it was questionable as to whether or not wands could truly be fully mastered via this method of attainment, it is known that wands obtained in this way (e.g. ones with a familial connection) worked a little better than wands chosen at random.[54] Both Neville and Ron were more successful at using magic with store-bought wands that had actually chosen them. However, Holly Blackbird, an American witch, possessed a wand which had been in her family for four generations, and she was an incredibly powerful witch.[55]\n\nMost witches and wizards got their first wand when they were eleven — just before starting their magical education. Most English wizards and witches bought their wands at Ollivanders in Diagon Alley, where they would try out multiple wands until they found the one that suited them, or rather, the wand found the wizard that suited it. When trying out different wands, a wand that was not suited to its wielder would usually not do anything at all. However, a warm feeling was an indication of having chosen the right wand, and the wand sometimes emitted a few sparks or did some similar, small sign of magic.[25] The precise reasons for which particular wands chose which particular wizards was not entirely clear, but certain wands seemed to have a natural affinity for certain wizards or witches.\n\nShops that dealt in dark artefacts would sometimes have the wands of particularly famous or infamous witches and wizards in their stock. In the 1990s, Borgin and Burkes had the wand of the Dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald in their shop, which they sold to an magical artefacts collector.[56]\n\nIn the United States of America, upon purchasing a wand, the buyer was given a Wand Registration Number, which was required for applications for wand permits. MACUSA had a Central Wand Archive.[57]\n\nThe right to carry a wand at all times was established by the International Confederation of Wizards in 1692, when Muggle persecution was at its height and the wizards were planning their retreat into hiding.[58]\n\nIn accordance to Clause Three in the Code of Wand Use,[59] non-human beings, such as goblins and house-elves, were prohibited from owning or using wands. For goblins in particular, this prohibition had been a point of contention with the wizarding community and caused some outbreaks of violence. No known formal prohibition existed against Muggles possessing a wand; they would be unable to use them anyway since Muggles didn't possess magic, but a Muggle's possession of a wand could be considered a breach of the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy.\n\nAny underage wizards or witches who were expelled from school were forbidden from practising magic any further, and their wands had been confiscated and destroyed. Rubeus Hagrid's wand suffered such a fate, though it was somewhat repaired and kept inside his umbrella, and he was allowed to use that much. However, if the student in question was expelled after taking the Ordinary Wizarding Level, they were deemed to be full-fledged wizards and might retain their wands. It was because of this that Newt Scamander retained his wand when he was expelled.[citation needed]\n\nGellert Grindelwald was expelled from Durmstrang, but he managed to maintain his wand (or procure another one), suggesting the wand confiscation may have only applied to Hogwarts students. Any criminals arrested and imprisoned lost their wands as well. Barty Crouch Jnr claimed that he was not allowed a wand since Azkaban, though their wands seemed not destroyed but simply stored away because Bellatrix Lestrange managed to retrieve her old wand after escaping prison.\n\nPreviously, due to Rappaport's Law, no underaged North American witch or wizard was allowed a wand until they arrived at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Moreover, wands had to be left at Ilvermorny during vacations and only upon attaining seventeen years of age was the witch or wizard legally allowed to carry a wand outside school. This law was to ensure that the International Statute of Secrecy was upheld.[60] MACUSA did not want a repeat of Dorcus Twelvetrees's breach of the statute. However, this law was repealed in 1965.\n\nDuring the last year of the Second Wizarding War, the British Ministry of Magic was overthrown by the Death Eaters, and new laws were put into effect. Muggle-born witches and wizards were regarded as having \"stolen\" their magic from \"real\" witches and wizards, and their wands (which were also considered stolen) were confiscated. Those who were not imprisoned were usually left destitute.\n\nThe wand was originally a European invention, and although many makers of wands existed, Garrick Ollivander was the best known and most experienced in Britain in the 1990s. He came from a well known wandmaking family that had been making wands since 382 BC out of a shop located in Diagon Alley, London. Mr Ollivander went missing in the summer of 1996[5] until discovered by Harry, Ron and Hermione and rescued by the house-elf Dobby in 1998; he had been kidnapped by Death Eaters on Voldemort's orders. Ollivander thereafter told Harry about the Elder Wand and how a wand passed ownership.[6] More British wandmakers existed, for example, Jimmy Kiddell's Wonderful Wands, but their wands were stated to be not as good as Ollivander's, and several were known to have gone out of business trying to directly compete with Ollivander's.\n\nAnother notable wand maker was Mykew Gregorovitch, who had once obtained and studied the Elder Wand. Gregorovitch's reputation rivalled that of Ollivander's with some, like Viktor Krum, considering his wands the best in the world. Krum's statement also suggests this view was more common outside of Britain. By 1997 he had retired as a wand maker, with Krum purchasing one of his last wands. In 1997, Voldemort tracked him down, as part of his quest to find and obtain Elder Wand. However, by that time, the wand had long since it had left Gregorovitch's possession, having been stolen by a blond-haired young man that the wand maker had never identified. Once Voldemort finished questioning Gregorovitch, he murdered him as he was of no more use to the dark wizard.[28]\n\nHistorical wandmakers in North America included Isolt Sayre, Violetta Beauvais, Johannes Jonker, Thiago Quintana, and Shikoba Wolfe, each of whom specialised in a single type of wand core.\n\nAccording to legend, Death created the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand in existence, from the branch of an elder tree. Albus Dumbledore, however, believed that Antioch Peverell was more the likely creator.[61]",
