  "content": "The Tales of Beedle the Bard was a collection of stories written for young wizards and witches by Beedle the Bard. It was published by Chelf Press and had original illustrations by Luxo Karuzos. They were popular bedtime stories for centuries, with the result being that The Wizard and the Hopping Pot and The Fountain of Fair Fortune were as familiar to many of the students at Hogwarts, as Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty are to various Muggle children.[3]\n\nBeedle's stories resembled Muggle fairy tales in many respects; for instance, virtue was usually rewarded and wickedness punished. However, there was one very obvious difference. In Muggle fairy tales, magic tended to lie at the root of the hero or heroine's troubles — the wicked witch had poisoned the apple, put the princess into a hundred years' sleep or turned the prince into a hideous beast.[3]\n\nIn The Tales of Beedle the Bard, on the other hand, we met heroes and heroines who could perform magic themselves, and yet find it just as hard to solve their problems as the Muggle heroes did. Beedle's stories had helped generations of wizarding parents to explain this painful fact of life to their young children: that magic caused as much trouble as it cured.[3]\n\nAnother notable difference between these fables and their Muggle counterparts was that Beedle's witches were much more active in seeking their fortunes than our fairy-tale heroines. Asha, Altheda, Amata and Babbitty Rabbity were all witches who took their fate into their own hands, rather than a prolonged nap or waiting for someone to return a lost shoe. The exception to this rule — the unnamed maiden of 'The Warlock's Hairy Heart' — acted more like a Muggle's idea of a storybook princess, but there was no happily ever after at the end of her tale.[3]\n\nMost of these tales (with the exception of The Warlock's Hairy Heart) had been rewritten by Beatrix Bloxam and compiled into her book The Toadstool Tales, which had since been banned since it had a tendency to induce nausea and vomiting in the children who read, or had to listen to, them.[3]\n\nIn 2008, Minerva McGonagall permitted the publication of a new edition which featured a new translation of the stories from Ancient Runes by Hermione Granger, notes by Albus Dumbledore, and an introduction by J. K. Rowling.[3] A Hogwarts student purchased a copy of it around the 2010–2011 school year and bumped into Hermione herself afterwards, who admitted to being the translator of the book.[5]\n\nOne story by Beedle was The Tale of the Three Brothers. This story was about brothers who met Death on the road and avoided his clutches; each in turn received a gift from him, although Death managed to claim them all.[2][6]\n\nOn 30 December 1997, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley came to hear the legend: The brothers came to a river which was too deep to wade across, and built a bridge using magic. Death appeared before them and congratulated them for their ingenuity, and offered each of them a reward (or so he said; his real intent was to give them traps which would be their undoing, because he felt cheated by their survival). The first brother asked for a weapon that would always win any battle, a weapon worthy of one who had cheated Death. Death snapped a twig off an elder tree and gave it to him — the Elder Wand. The second brother arrogantly wanted to humiliate Death further and asked for something to give him power to bring loved ones back from the grave. Death gave him a river stone, which, by the terms of the deal, became the Resurrection Stone. The third brother, however, did not trust Death, and asked for something that would allow him to continue on his way with Death being able to harm him. Death was trapped by his words, and handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility. The brothers continued on and went their separate ways.[2][6]\n\nTime passed. The first brother provoked a duel with a wizard he disliked, left him for dead, and afterwards boasted of his unbeatable wand. He was killed that very night by someone who had heard his boasting, and wanted the wand. The second brother found misery when he brought his former lover back to life with the Resurrection Stone. She was cold and unhappy, as she didn't belong in the living world anymore. He ultimately committed suicide in order to truly join her. The third brother was able to hide from Death his entire life using the cloak. It was only when he finally reached a ripe old age did he finally remove the cloak and gave it to his son. He and Death finally \"met as old friends\", and departed as equals.[2][6]\n\nThe items mentioned in the tale became legendary artefacts known together as the Deathly Hallows. Ignotus Peverell and his two older brothers, Cadmus and Antioch were believed to be the original owners of the Hallows, and therefore the inspiration for the story. According to legend, if one joined the Hallows together, they would make the wielder extremely powerful, the \"Master of Death\". (Dumbledore later states that the true Master of Death is one who accepts that it is inevitable, in much the same way Ignotus did. Dumbledore was also the one to reveal finally that the three brothers were the Peverells, though he believes that the tale of how they received the items is a fabrication, which would naturally appear around such powerful items, and that the Peverells were simply talented wizards who created the items themselves.)[6]\n\nLord Voldemort sought the Elder Wand because he believed it would allow him to defeat Harry Potter. However, it was Harry himself who temporarily became the Master of Death, when he ultimately united all three artefacts.[7][8][9]",
