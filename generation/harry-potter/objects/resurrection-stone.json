  "content": "The Resurrection Stone was one of the fabled Deathly Hallows. In The Tale of the Three Brothers, it was the second Hallow created, supposedly by Death himself. It was bestowed upon Cadmus Peverell after he requested, as his bounty, something with the power to recall loved ones from Death. However, those brought back from the dead were never fully alive and the returned spirits were said to dislike resurrection.[7][1]\n\nAccording to the legend of the Deathly Hallows, anyone in possession of the Resurrection Stone, the Cloak of Invisibility and the Elder Wand would be The Master of Death.[5][1] However, Albus Dumbledore regarded Harry Potter as the \"true master of death\", not because of the fact that he had united the Hallows, but for truly accepting death and not fearing it.[5]\n\nIt was one of the two Hallows known to have been successfully passed down from generation to generation since Cadmus's time, the other being the Cloak of Invisibility. In 1943, it passed to the possession of Tom Riddle who unknowingly stole it while it was still concealed in Marvolo Gaunt's Ring, which he turned into a Horcrux. The ring was destroyed in 1996 by Albus Dumbledore, but the stone was placed in Harry Potter's first Golden Snitch until it passed into the possession of Harry Potter who used it to great success in the Second Wizarding War.\n\nCreated by Death, the Resurrection Stone had the power to bring back lost loved ones. However, those brought back from the dead were never fully alive and the returned spirits were said to dislike resurrection.[7]\n\nWhen the Resurrection Stone was turned three times in the user's hand, it will temporarily return the dead, although they never seem to come back fully. These summoned shades were more physically solid than a ghost but less so than a living body, possibly similar to Priori Incantatem reappearing \"echoes\" of the dead, though their exact nature was unclear. Harry Potter described them as almost transparent, and they produced a Patronus-like effect that shielded against Dementors. They remained visible only as long as the stone was held and only the person who was holding the Stone could see them. These shades were said to dislike being drawn from their rightful place in the afterlife as they did not belong in the living world anymore, though Harry Potter's loved ones made no complaints when he summoned them.[6]\n\nGellert Grindelwald mistakenly believed that the Stone could be used to create an army of Inferi.\n\nAccording to legend, whoever reunited it with the other two Hallows, the Elder Wand and the Cloak of Invisibility, would become the Master of Death. Though this was generally assumed to mean that the wielder would have some form of immortality, though this was never proven.[1]\n\nHarry Potter possessed all three Hallows (all though never at the same time) yet never became the Master of Death as in conquering death. Albus Dumbledore theorised that being the \"true master of death\" meant accepting one's mortality and not fearing it, rather than uniting the Hallows.[8]\n\nAccording to the legend recounted by Beedle the Bard in The Tale of the Three Brothers, Cadmus Peverell, and his two  brothers were travelling along a long, winding road at twilight when they came upon a river too deep and rapid to cross. When the brothers conjured a bridge to cross the river, Death appeared before them. Angry that they had found a way to cross the river without dying, Death pretended to offer each brother a gift, hoping that the gift would lead to their downfall.\n\nAs Cadmus was arrogant, he wanted to further humiliate Death, which led to him asking for the Resurrection Stone. He wished for an item that would enable him to bring back the dead, so Death took a stone from the riverbank and used his abilities to transform it into the Resurrection Stone.[1]\n\nAlbus Dumbledore thought it was unlikely that the Resurrection Stone was made by Death, it may have been created by the second oldest of the three Peverell brothers, Cadmus. Regardless of how the Stone was truly created, Cadmus used it to attempt to bring back a girl he had loved and was prepared to marry before her untimely death. While he was able to bring back a shade of her, he felt as though a \"veil\" separated them, and he could tell that she was suffering greatly from being forced back among the world of the living. Realising the limitations of the Stone, Cadmus killed himself out of grief so that he could truly be with her.[5]\n\nHowever, given that some aspects of the tale were just fictionalised by Beedle, it is possible that this account of Cadmus's death was one of it. Furthermore, there are no means for Beedle to know what had really happened, much less Cadmus's intentions.\n\nSometime after Cadmus's death (or perhaps even by Cadmus himself), the Resurrection Stone was fitted into a ring. This ring was passed down as a family heirloom for the Peverell family, and eventually the Gaunt family, as knowledge of what the Stone was, and even what the symbol on it meant, became lost. Eventually, it made its way into the possession of Marvolo Gaunt, who would use the ring to flaunt the purity of his blood, such as he did to Bob Ogden when the latter came to call about Morfin Gaunt's attack on Tom Riddle Snr.[2]\n\nAfter Marvolo died shortly after serving a six-month sentence in Azkaban for attacking Bob Ogden, the ring was inherited by his son Morfin. He would wear the ring until Tom Riddle came to the Gaunt shack seeking information about his wizarding family. Sensing that the ring was a family heirloom, Riddle would pocket it after killing his Muggle relatives and framing Morfin for the murder.[3]\n\nFor a time, Riddle wore the ring containing the Stone. However, once he had ascertained from Professor Horace Slughorn that creating multiple Horcruxes was at least hypothetically possible, he used the murder of his father to turn the ring, and thus the Stone, into his second Horcrux.\n\nAfter this time, he hid the ring back in the Gaunt shack, putting numerous magical protections on the site to keep the Horcrux safe.[4] Due to Riddle turning the Stone into a Horcrux, he either did not know of its status as one of the three Hallows and power or simply did not care. He would not care because he had no loved ones to resurrect, as he did not feel love and feared the dead.[5] It is more likely that he did not know about the stone.\n\nAfter spending many months looking into Voldemort's past, Albus Dumbledore was able to track down the location of the ring and retrieve it. Though he had long since abandoned his personal quest to find the Deathly Hallows, he immediately realised that this ring contained the Resurrection Stone. Completely forgetting that the ring was a Horcrux in his haste to see his sister Ariana once more, he put the ring on.\n\nAt this point, a lethal curse activated, one that would have killed Dumbledore if not for the timely action of himself and Severus Snape. Still, it shortened Dumbledore's life expectancy to a year and crippled his hand, and at this Dumbledore once again realised he was unfit to use the Stone.[5] After using Godric Gryffindor's Sword to destroy the Horcrux within the ring, Dumbledore sealed the Stone within the very first Golden Snitch Harry Potter had ever caught and made arrangements to have Harry inherit the Stone in his will.\n\nFor the greater part of the Horcrux hunt, Harry Potter kept the Snitch containing the Stone in his mokeskin pouch. He was unable to get to the stone inside, due to charms placed upon it by Albus Dumbledore. On 2 May 1998 the Battle of Hogwarts broke out. During the one-hour armistice that marked the end of the first half of the battle, Harry found out through the memories of Severus Snape that he himself was the last Horcrux. As he walked to his death Harry was finally able to retrieve the Stone. He placed the Snitch to his lips and revealed his intention to die.[6]\n\nAt this, the Snitch opened and the Stone fell into his hand. Harry turned it over in his hand thrice, and was immediately joined by the shades of his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin. The presence of his loved ones was enough to give him the courage to keep going, and they remained with him until he made his way to where Voldemort was. At this point, the stone slipped from Harry's hands and he never went to search for it, with the intention that it would be lost in the forest forever.[6]",
